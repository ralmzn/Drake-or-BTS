"[Verse]
Put my feelings on ice
Always been a gem
Certified lover boy, somehow still heartless
Heart is only gettin' colder",1
"[Verse]
Hands are tied
Someone's in my ear from the other side
Tellin' me that I should pay you no mind
Wanted you to not be with me all night
Wanted you to not stay with me all night
I know, you know, who that person is to me
Doesn't really change things

[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, surely you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you

[Bridge]
In mind you make me want to do things, love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to, remind you
Ayy

[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, by now you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you",1
"[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Wassup ladies?
Swishahouse, baby
Wassup to all the ladies on the Northside, Southside, Eastside, Westside?
Wassup in Bay City?
Wassup to all the ladies in Louisiana?
Wassup to all the ladies in Dallas, Austin, San Antonio?
Marshall, Prairie View, it's going down
Wharton County, Texas City, H-Town, baby
TSU ladies

[Chorus]
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 1]
I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got the drac' in the studio and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit

[Chorus]
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to sli-
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 2]
Her daddy is not around, momma is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

[Chorus]
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to sli-
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came for my life and I'm just recordin' this shit",1
"[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Pipe this shit up and I turn this shit up
When I was down, I was down
Now them diamonds for fun like damn
Ayy, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Trendsetter, Ben Frank getter (Yeah)
Whip whatever, whip whatever
I buy diamonds when I'm under pressure (Yeah)
When I apply it, shit don’t ever let up, yeah
Look, I'm in the cut, The Boy in the cut
Jump in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up
All of this grindin' for what?
It’s funny when you niggas thought it was luck
I cannot give you a pass if you play with my money and family and friends
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him

[Chorus: Drake]
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
And I'm way up at the top of the loft
Gotta stay up, ain't no knockin' me off
Pull up smooth, A.I. with the cross (Haha)
Countin' up wins on wins on wins, for all of my dawgs I lost
I might call Pharrell, get the new Chanel
Thugger got the YSL, huh
I remember when the Feds did the sweep, I pray my dawgs didn't tell, huh
Cruisin’ down Biscayne
I was in Miami, she gave me top with the top off
Cartier wrist gang, got her a Audemar
She got the head, knock your socks off
You ain’t gettin' money, you ain’t fuckin' with me
You ain't in your bitch top five
I might pull up in the Six with Drizzy
I was just in Houston, fuckin' with the mob ties
We don’t never ever play two sides
Hang out the Phantom, it's suicide
They ridin' my wave like a rogue tide
My necklace is wet like the poolside

[Chorus: Drake, Drake & Roddy Ricch]
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut, yeah
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
You ask how many girls I been with in my life
I tell ya, ""I stopped keeping count when I was 25""
I ask you the same thing, you tell me, ""Seven guys""
But we both know that's a lie
'Cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights
Then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
But it's still nowhere close to mine
Marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
He took over like four years ago when Courtne had resigned
I been talkin' sex with Courtne since like 2005
We been friends since junior high
Tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
She's like, ""Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?""
And I say, ""Yeah, that's bein' kind""
At one point or another they all felt like they were mine
I had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind
I'm not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time
I like when it's you and I
Plus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you
That could jeopardize your pride and I'm not into choosin' sides
Unless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side
It's the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide
Lessons that I learned before hittin' my prime
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Things you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes
Free myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise
Yeah

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
You say you wanna know but you don't though
Why you wanna know who I cropped out of photos?
And lately, papi, you been acting tonto
What you think before you, I was only movin' dolo
But I'm honest 'til I die, so I won't lie
And I prolly got some numbers that you won't like
And you're prolly gonna hate it
But I much rather be hated for the truth than for the wrong guy if he ain't done
You can't be this good without some badness
What? You think I fuck this good without some practice?
And if it's LOV and you're my MVP
Then why we talkin' about practice?
Like you want me to lie
Why would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
'Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini
Might be jealousy, 'cause you just want me tradin' lives
Jealousy, 'cause I can get the girls and get the guys
And if I'm honest, this whole convo's just a waste of time
'Cause legacy should be my focus, not here playin' wife",1
"[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?",1
"[Intro: Pimp C]
Man, get the fuck away from us, we don't want nothin' but money
We some family men, we gettin' this paper
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And I had to put that out there, Bun
Because a lot of niggas doin' lot of Fugazi shit out here, man

[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Verse]
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me
See you makin' all this time for more important things
We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs?
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin' outside (Hah)

[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Outro: Diddy]
Uhm, you was just so in your pocket, uhm
Cats used to tell me when they used to come to my house in Miami and shit
That, that, that they felt a feelin' of like
They felt a lil' fucked up in they stomach
But, they was inspired 'cause they knew they, they, they had somethin' to see the dream for, you know?
I done seen a lot of shit, I ain't never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
And then, when you've finally got the crib (All you do is lie to me)
You did it like, not even none of us did it, you feel me? Uhm
Nah, I mean I did it like that, I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie to you
I did it like that, but, I ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
How cats told me that he'd been inspired (All you do is lie to me)
And felt that feelin' in they gut, like ""I gotta work harder"" (Need more than a homie)
Well I mean workin' harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real
It's either you fuckin' in the game or you're out the game
Nigga, I'm back in this motherfucker, let's get some money
It's over, nigga, you have arrived, top five, end of discussion
May God bless you, Inshallah, you know what I'm sayin'?
This your brother, Diddy, take that
And thank you for the inspiration, jheeze",1
"[Chorus]
Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Think you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me now

[Verse]
Say, say I'm so crazy, baby
I wanted you to race my mind
I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to erase my mind

"[Intro]
Previously on Ready To Die

[Chorus]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Never had a lot, this is all I need

[Verse 1]
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like pardon my reach
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me

[Chorus]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

[Verse 2]
You should slide through and get your back broke
Used to be involved with me with no emotion
I was on the way to the next show
You was on the phone and you were so open
Heard you said you're over me, is that so?
You don't ever filter girl and that's okay
Coulda held on but you let it go
Sayin' to yourself that it's better this way
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Feelings I've been stackin' like a bankroll
I should probably find a way to let it go
Wonder what it was that turned you this cold
Said you left me jaded and I wasn't joking
Miss the way it was a couple years ago
Back when we was young and now you've outgrown me
Hard to just accept I was a steppin' stone
Way that people talk about you I should've known
You're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke",1
"[Intro]
For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

[Verse 2]
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention

[Chorus]
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'",1
"[Intro]
Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
""Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?""
(June, you're a genius)
I said, ""I respect it, no problem""
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real

[Verse]
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, ""Damn, coach, put him in""
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

[Outro]
For real
Facts, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hahaha, yeah",1
"[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, ""Babe, I think there was a typo""
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway

First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply

Trust
Trust who?
Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Oh, trust who?
Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
I'll take it
Just tell me it can't be that crazy
And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oh, just save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things
That I do believe, but I don't even
Want you to get in my mind

[Verse 2: Drake with Chris Brown]
Trust me and I can set you free
Left your man, came straight to me
You the real MVP, my love
Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, my love
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? (Love)
I've given you enough time

I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 1: Future]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string

I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you

'Cause you got desires

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's a ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from, they serve the soda clean (Clean, clean)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it

[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)

'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 3: Drake]
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started

Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà

I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal

Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry

(Yeah, family)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

You got some liquor at the house?

Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it

Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

Skrrt 'round there in your ends, whole southside on ten
Not like them, make men lean out Benz
That's how a man get blem, you and your friends
This Hermés from runway, this ain't Ralph Lauren
Tell them again, loved her way back when
Drunk so I type ""Je t'aime"" but don't hit send
Send some bread to the pen
All my G's are blessed, we check in for them
Whole lotta charges laid to this day
No confessions for them
Man really feel no ways, these man waste
No progression for them
Think you're bad, just wait, food get ate
And that's just lessons for them
Sosa (Sosa), Fivi (Fivi), lookin' like KD and Kyrie (I am)
My TD Bank is on what? (What?)
My TD Bank is on Kylie (Ayy, ayy)

Head game great, huh, she let me nut on her face, ayy, ayy, ayy
Uh, every time she link, she come with an eighth (Baow)
Viral, you ain't never make a movie with Drake (Baow)
Sponsor (Sponsor), I take a Perc, now I'm turned to a monster (Turned to a monster)
Uh, I'm in the court like ""I'm sorry, your honor"" (I'm sorry, your honor, lil' bitch, baow)

London, man, I need me a thick bitch (A thick)
And a Louis bag just so I can fit me the grip in (Grip)
I got the swag, so tell me the difference
Mike Amiri, best believe they fitted
She wanna fuck, but I ain't with it
Headshot, knock him off his fitted
Punch him out, send that boy to that dentist
Talkin' Henny, it better be Privilège, ayy
Baow, what?
It better be Privilège

[Verse]
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled ""Surprise!"", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course...

Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah

Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself

Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately

We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, ""When that shit is real, you just know""
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, ""I feel you, nigga, I already know""
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, ""You gotta leave already?""
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said ""You're mine"" I was yours already

Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already

Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy

I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, ""Okay, if you say so""
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya

We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since ""No Scrubs"" and ""No Pigeons""
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
""Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike""
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, ""You did that""
They even hit my line like, ""Where you been at?""
It's always on some shit like
""When can I get a favor?"" or, ""Where my bitch at?""
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, ""Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?""
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind

[Outro]
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
Uh-huh, yeah
That's right, yeah",1
"[Intro]
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

[Verse]
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah",1
"[Verse 1]
Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should've did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

[Chorus]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely

[Verse 2]
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely

[Chorus]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I get lonely too
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely

[Outro]
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you",1
"[Intro]
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like, fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take you down through there
Make me wanna take you down through there
I'll take it there

[Chorus 1]
Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

[Verse]
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

[Chorus 2]
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Interlude: Dennis Graham]
But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang...
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…

[Verse 2: Drake]
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back",1
"[Intro]
Ha, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, ""Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?""
They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go""
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, ""Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?""
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 2]
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 3]
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?""
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Outro: Bob Marley]
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here",1
"[Intro: Rick Ross]
Tat my name on you, girl, so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell a bad bitch ""Girl, let's go hang""
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no

[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll (Uh)
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled

[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make do with what's left
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit til I'm gone
Yeah, I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real
What's up?

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it

"[Verse 1]
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

[Chorus]
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Interlude]
What are we even doing?

[Verse 2]
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, ""You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him""
And I say ""Well, goddamn""

[Chorus]
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Outro: Dennis Graham & Drake]
All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.  
I agree
This shit, that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom

"[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy, James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games

"[Chorus]
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh

Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

[Verse]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I

[Chorus]
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know

[Post-Chorus]
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back",1
"[Intro: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Yeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

[Outro: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Can I? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Before I turn the lights out",1
"[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah",1
"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face

Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it",1

All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my 'Malis pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself",1

Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter

Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me

Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me

Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went

Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents

They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate

All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

If you need me, you can call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make

All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment

I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'",1

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys (True)

[Bridge: Drake]
Yeah, never a matter of ""could I?"" or ""should I?""
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—

[Outro: Plies]
Hahaha, I can't argue with you, no! You mad!
Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh
I'm happy! Leave me alone!
I just want some money, a lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you? You ain't nobody!
You mad",1

Twenty-nine is comin', they on edge when I cook (Cook)

UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

Blast that shit back if you blastin'

Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

Ooh, ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

[Chorus: Sample]
Yeah, no more, no more

Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap

Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em
Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become

"[Verse 1: Drake]
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

[Outro: Nai Palm]
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me)
It feels so exciting

It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you",1

What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me

— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is… did that — but obviously it takes time— You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoon–
— That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always honeymoon season

I think you're changing your mind

And we're already done

Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see
You liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl

I kept you sane, I kept it peaceful, don't lie

You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby

I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Verse 2]
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind",1
"[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday
Yeah, who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to–

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control (Oh oh)
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
They tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it (And you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, ""Play this shit,"" they better play it (Ayy, play it)
For you (For you), on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to–

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)

Yeah, woo

I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch (Uh-huh)
Never let a clown nigga try to play you (Okay)
If he play you, then rule number two (Okay)
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men (Okay)
And– (Wow, that's how you feel?)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try and get you off my mind

I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer

You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (After dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 1: Drake & Static Major]
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (After dark)

Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, ""Fuck these niggas,"" rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, ""Do anything, but just don't lie to me""
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes

You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (Hi)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now

Here we go, yeah

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this my G

I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man

Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me

Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD

Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate

Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter

Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'

I'm talkin' woods like them clowns (you get it?)
I got my mink off a monkey
I'm talkin' monkey like Jumanji (hrr)
All your diamonds partly sunny
I'm talkin' sunny like D, Sunny (Sunny Delight)
My diamonds wet, it cost me money
I'm talkin' wet like it's runnin' (sink)
I'm talkin' wet like Katrina (New Orleans)
I'm talkin' wet like Dasani, huh

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—",1
"[Intro: DJ Paul]
You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

[Chorus: Drake]
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Outro: Dave]
Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'

Demon just got out the can (Yeah)
I gave my bro an advance (Yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yaad
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep (Oof)
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is greaze (Greaze!)
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet (Yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
Jheeze!

You know dem ones? Hahaha
Yeah, ahh!

Bringin' that dirty-dirty, bringin' that certy (Certy)
Mizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty (Rah!)
I've got bitches in the merky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy (Oof!)
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky (Jerky)
Whippin' that white girl (Yeah?), cookin' that Cersei (Dah!)
I was pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal (Yeah)
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo (Mmm!)
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, and this is that hard dough (Yeah)

"[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

This is the 6’s year

Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

[Chorus: Drake]
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything

[Verse 3: Drake]
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, ""Are we straight?""
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

[Outro: Sandi Graham]
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.",1

'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up

As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

"[Background: Snoh Aalegra]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life",1
"More Life.
 
More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray it's true
 
I've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
 
But if someone should come collecting

Sooner than we're all expecting
 
At least the life you lived was one for you

— Drake",1
"[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh",1
"[Intro]
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro]
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....",1
"[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit",1
"[Verse]
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah

"[Intro: Baka & Drake]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk

Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done",1
"[Intro]
One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

[Outro]
Yeah, that's right, yeah",1
"[Intro]
Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

[Outro]
Yeah
I know",1

Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time

I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 2]
Oh, and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—

Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot

Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at

All this for my family, man, I try my hardest

You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way

Question is, will I ever leave you?

No, no, no, no

The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Chorus]
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Verse 2]
I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeah, you know wassup, yeah
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend

I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package

Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace

We should get out, we haven't talked in a while

Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man

Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)

Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced

Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston

I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, ""You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that""
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to
But we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin'
On some ""why-you-love-these-strippers?"" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh!
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call

Rider shit

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah
And she like, ""Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price

You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life",1

I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen

Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline

I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me

They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service

Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah

Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year

Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things

And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man

[Verse]
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

[Chorus 2]
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man",1

[Intro]
Yeah, alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us",1

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Beat Switch]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
Cause we—

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)

How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours

Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh

Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry""
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us

Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up

You shouldn't have to deal with that

I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?

You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with ""this time will be different""

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself

To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground

Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging

[Verse 3]
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl",1

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""

Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, Big Tyme
""Sunshine,"" tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami

They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man
The spark ain't enough for you

You smart and you know it, I get it I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, ""Girl get your paperwork right""

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'",1

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said ""Hov, it ain't many of us""
I told 'em ""Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us""

Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it,"" it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg",1
"[Intro]
Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do

Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do

So get your ass in that car and come through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh

Got everything, I got everything

In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working

Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to

When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah",1
"[Chorus 1: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At the strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning

[Refrain: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

[Refrain: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says ""I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place; not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misin-terpret
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me

Yeah
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you",1

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out ""Money over everything!""
""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Outro Poem]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better",1

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland
Why? 'Cause

They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

"[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna & Drake]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost",1
"[Intro: Ericka Lee]
Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had

Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
""Well, I'm sorry""

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here, then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, ""You niggas crazy""
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We really gonna be in some trouble, trouble",1

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died",1

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, ""Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah""
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance
Sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper
That's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga

But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh

Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, ""You was this and you had this""
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, ""you're such a dog"", I said, ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, ""show me some""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time

Yeah! Drizzy, yo' turn, nigga!
Take Care of the business, nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business, nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em!
Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, fellas

Yeah, you understand me?

"[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is

And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me (I got it now) (Huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me
All we wanted was an opportunity
(Just Blaze!) Lord knows!

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo!)
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real (Woo!)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping (Woo!)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy (Woo!)
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh!)
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh! You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal

I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink (Huh!)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (Woo!)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views (Views)
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews (Jews)
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (Huh!), came to buy the bar (Huh!)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (Woo!)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R (Woo!)
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae (Anna Mae)
I run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game (Running game)
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate (Fornicate)
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great (Huh!)",1

How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies

Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies

Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 2]
But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town

"[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it

You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you

And the weekend's here, started it right

Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down

You must of done this before, this can't be your first time
We must of been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You must of done this before, this can't be your first time

'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it
If I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass

Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship, all of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote on quote, ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
'Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them, ""That ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
""Someone Like You,"" more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies",1

It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place.

That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)

They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

But when I get you to myself
You know what's going down, what's going down, oh

[Chorus]
Girl you look good, won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker, won't you back that ass up
Call me big daddy, won't you back that ass up
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know he messed up
But let a real nigga make it right
Let a real nigga make it right, you deserve that much
Let me put something in your life
Let me put something in your life, put something in your life
You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with
I'ma trust you, I'ma give you the benefit of the doubt, and I'ma love you
You can even call me daddy, give you someone to look up to

[Refrain]
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now, oh
After you back it up then stop
After you back it up then stop
Babygirl, after you back it up then stop
After you back it up then stop

[Outro]
I can tell that money's got you working
That your body's so wet
And we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh-ho
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me",1
"[Intro: Drake]
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man
I hate that shit
It’ll be a long time before y'all feel me, if ever
For real

[Verse 1: Drake]
You won’t feel me 'till everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

[Verse 2: Drake]
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long

[Verse 3: Drake]
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I’m driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay""

Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

"[Verse 1]
She says, ""Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic, don’t I? I get it poppin’, don’t I?
I’ll end up stoppin', won’t I? And by the time I end up stoppin'
You’ll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out
While shoppin' with a nigga, don’t lie
She’s losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes: don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make
I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone

"[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

Every night it's fireworks

Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

[Outro]

Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go

[Verse 1]
Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
""It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!""
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 2]
Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit ""redial"", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 3]
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over",1

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?

I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches (yeah)
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj & Drake]
I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)
Aww, aww, aww
Aww yeah we in this bitch
Aww, aww, aww

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it

Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Go, go, go, go, go (As we proceed)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

"[Part I]

[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

[Interlude: Drake & The-Dream]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on youKi-Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Uh, girl you the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest (Oh-whoa)
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shutting it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in them Louboutins
What you want, what you need (Yeah)
I can be (Yeah) your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream, Drake & The-Dream]
And together, we shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice (They'd know)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
Every time we come around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
(And they're on it) And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice
They'd know you shut it down

[Bridge: The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake & The-Dream]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets (Yes indeed)
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl, who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Chorus: The-Dream & Drake]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
You shut it, oh, oh
And they'd notice, they'd notice

[Bridge: The-Dream]
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down, down...

[Part II]

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take them fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it",1
"[Intro: Aaliyah]
Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just

[Chorus: Young Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say ""for life"", y'all say ""forever""
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the game

[Chorus: Young Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Outro: Young Jeezy & Aaliyah]
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
It's a beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil brah, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable
Let me know, let me know",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: ""Nobody's workin' as hard as you""
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

[Chorus: Drake & Jay-Z]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights'll make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do

[Chorus: Drake]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go",1
"[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, ""Tell me what's really goin' on""
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said ""If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em""
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa",1
"[Verse 1]
All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Verse 2]
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Outro]
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night",1
"[Verse 1]
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Bridge]
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart",1
"[Chorus]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

[Verse 1]
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

[Chorus]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

[Verse 2]
Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

[Chorus]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now",1
"[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup
Noel That’s it Ahhhhhh",1

Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright
And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in

And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, ""Hey now, now, watch her go down""
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
''Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)

And she dance to the song
And it go, ""Hey now, now, watch her go down""

The money (Money), cars (Cars)
The clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1: Drake]
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude]
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
Yeah, I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, ""God""
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details, boy",1

You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city

I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends

I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?

Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said ""I seen it all"", I say ""No you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard",1
"[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause

[Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah

[Outro]
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like
Man",1
"[Intro]
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this ""venting""

[Verse 1]
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 2]
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 3]
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me",1
"[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright

She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy

'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

The clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I want the money (Money), money and the cars

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1: Drake]
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it

I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
Yeah, I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, ""God""
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details, boy",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, ""This just ain't my style""
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me, no

[Chorus: Peter Bjorn & John]
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off

Look, leave me, leave me, I can't fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah

Did you agree we should let it be?

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Chorus]
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone",1
"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

Woo, Young Mula, baby
Yeah",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus: Drake]
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

[Chorus: Drake & Lloyd]
Come right in, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Outro: Lloyd]
Oh, it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio",1
"[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real

[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say",1
"[Verse 1: Drake & Lykke Li]
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

[Verse 2: Drake & Lykke Li]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you, oh
Oh, oh",1
"[Intro]
You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had

[Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it

You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it

Uhh, ah yeah
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are
I got you",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop""
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Bridge: Santigold]
I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

Yo what up? It's Chris Paul, CP3, feel my man Drake, So Far Gone, Drake, I gotchu homie, I gotchu. Let's get 'em",1
"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on",1
"[Verse 1]
Uh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else

You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?
Night's fallin', lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget

Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause

[Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah

Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like

This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late

[Bridge]
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Show me if this is brand new (Brand new)
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
New, new, new (Brand new), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah",1
"[Verse 1]
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations

[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh

[Verse 3]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest""
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention",1
"[Spoken Word: Drake]
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom. After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm. What you got?Comeback",1

[Verse 1]
Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, ""Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?""
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin ""white Phantom sittin' on dub"" money
I am talkin ""cold champagne at the club"" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from

[Interlude]
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise

Shout out to 40-40
Yeah my right hand!",1

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, ""Is that a rose?""
""You mean Rosé? Why yes it is""
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man",1
"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say ""My baby's famous and I knew it"" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Hook: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And ""Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest""
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

"[Intro: Trey Songz]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to Louis
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn
And all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't, now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? (Probably not)
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life (She gone)
Tryna find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean
And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what I mean

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 3: Drake]
With the other dudes she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and then they break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heatstroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't , now you don’t
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Let's go",1
"[Verse]
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, ""No speak-a la ingles""
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke

[Refrain]
Life of a don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds",1
"[Verse]
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, ""Baby, those are cute, I adore those""
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, ""my sweet surrender""
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
""Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting""
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!",1
"[Intro: Drake talking]
Okay...
There comes a time...
When you gotta be like
You know, I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now, you know?
But I just—I just tell myself this one thing

[Verse: Drake]
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time, I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit, but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah, Heartbreak Drake, I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
Go—Go—Go—Goddamn, how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But ugh, tell me you surfing, let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Fords
Ethiopian girl, Ethiopian girl
With your long, curly hair and yo' big ass boo-tay
Reading all them pro-Black, pro-female books
Just let 'em, let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription, a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And man, if '09 is when I'ma see mine
Being cool ain't enough, homie; I'ma freeze time, like that!",1
"[Hook (x3)]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world

[Verse: Drake]
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball

[Hook]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Hennessy, straight, no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? They call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya",1
"[Chorus: Dwele & Drake]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl? (Yeah)
I can't believe it (I know you got a man)
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything (Kick it to you like this)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...

[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
Look, we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreating
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus, your man still there, let's be fair
You'd do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, 'cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan
It's my bad, should've chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl, playing
I'm saying, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon

[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man?
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Ugh, ugh, I met her at the bar, sipping on Patrón
And now, it's been three years off and on
'Cause the same page, we are rarely often on
'Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (C'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was building a house and home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that she don't know what to do with her life
'Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute, she mad at me; next minute, it's all good
And I'm in her body like ""Gray's Anatomy""
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (Ugh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, ""Damn, if only her nigga knew,"" but...
(Hahaha, yeah)

[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything, baby",1

You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
(Ohh Yeah)
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one

And then expect favors (Yea)

"[Hook: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall

[Hook]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Hook]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope",1

I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when ""fuck bitches, get money"" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single

If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

[Hook]",1
"I swear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?",1

I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[Verse 1: Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall

Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice

Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

[Hook: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

[Verse 2: Richie Sosa]
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up

[Hook: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please

D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin' ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin' hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb

[Chorus: Drake]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded

I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
Bagging sour diesel, stinking like I got a few stumps
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like clothes, I’ve been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
Yo' girl got some nice titties, yeah, a perky set
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me

And naw it ain't a Buick

I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it

I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout
I mean for tonight hoe
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

[Hook: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog",1
"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
9th Wonder
Don't judge me, man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El 'bout to prove 'em wrong, though

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 2: Phonte]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit, I'm well-read like sunburn
And after me, you'll never leave no stone unturned

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying, so they coming off paper-thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down
To see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle
To get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play
But your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now, I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback, that's written all over your face
No, El will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off (work it off)
Baby I can give you extra credit (extra credit)
But there's something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hidin' WMD's
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?",1
"[Intro]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Drake]
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind

[Bridge]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Missin' everything you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

[Bridge]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

I can't stop, missing you
I can't stop, missing you

(Baby) I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop, missin' you",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Spoken Word: Lil Wayne]
Y-M, bitch, everyday
Two times on Sunday
Spitta!
Check your blinkers, baby
Check your blinkers, baby
Cause, to me, look like you’ve been turning right all day, yeah
Right my way, I got a boulevard, baby
That’s right, Cash Avenue
Wall Street gangsta
Carter, y'all
Why would I lie, yeah
I ain’t rich, bitch, I’m wealthy
Young, I talk shit til I die
Come kill me, nigga
Fuck you, no homo
She like it, yeah
Boy, these motherfucking glasses I got on right now
Are so motherfucking cold

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife

No, ain’t no nigga like me

"[Verse 1: Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 2: Von Pea]
It's been a couple weeks out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge it's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some, I have desired some, but that time is done
Now I am gon' give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures, this bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin', I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch, holla at me

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from ""Don't you have a man?"" ""Well...""
It all blowed over like Manuel Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill, man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, ""That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got
I'll lace you up but I ain't tryin' to tie the knot, so ah
From me you won't hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin' for
But you can't get my new shit, girl you spoken for

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 4: Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like ""I ain't getting service in your area""
You be like ""Nigga get your bars up""
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong, I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch, holla at me baby! (look)

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year

"[Intro]
Yo, what's going on? This is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada, my man's from down South
Ya understand, the number one DJ in the South to be exact
You heard that in the VMAs, you heard that wherever he goes
My man Smalls is out there, down south
Same time, reppin' for Toronto, Canada
Ya know what I mean?
So this right here, listening to right now is the official Southern Smoke Special Edition
I call it the ""Room For Improvement"" mixtape, cause I'm not perfect
And I bet neither are you if you listening
So you need to just accept what's there, know what I mean?
But look, you need to just let this play out
From track one, to track whatever, however-many-I-put-on-here
You need to just listen to this cause look man, this is the first time
Canadian, down south, my man, Smallz, your boy, Drake
You know what it is man, so just tune in nigga",1
"Thank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha",1
"[Intro]
Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh

[Hook]
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)

(Yeah; You never know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 2: Drake]
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh

(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do
(Vo we back man; Its a beautiful thing dog)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; I'm looking for somebody special man I'm serious; Ho!)

(Ho! You gotta help me man)
Can you help me?
(Uh)
Special
(Uh; yea; I need you to hold me down babe)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
Gotta be special
(Yeah; You never really know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh

(Yep; ho!; Were makin history right now man)
You can't just love me like they do
(Yea; And you a legend for real, ima give you that man)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; Yea; I know they out there man)
I know that out there theres a few
(Ho!; Yeah uh)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
(You gotta help me baby)

Yea my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

"[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2]
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Bridge]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do",1

(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

[Verse 1: Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

[Hook]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga!

"[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck

[Hook: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

[Hook: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows

"[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll

Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin
Its obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby
And people are shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at

Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex

Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you

Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good",1
"Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot
With the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
Circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like Macgyver
Cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple a years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Check
And nowadays some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing
Her reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

Of being in the background with your asses shakin'

To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm from the city where people be gettin' lazy
Litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass

And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
It's a shame cause now at his window
She throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder
'Cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it ain't you
I single-handedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plan's seeming ill
Whenever I'm out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center

And she a

To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a

And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will

Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers

Okay, I lied. Damn, I swear. Just call me back

[Message 3]
Okay! Alright! [?] hit it too! Why don’t you just call me back?",1
"[Drake talking]
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen

[Verse 1: Drake]
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like ""Where's my hi?""
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

[Drake talking]
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[Verse 2: Drake]
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says ""I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat""
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

[Drake talking]
Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is

[Verse 3: Drake]
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime

[Bridge (Drake talking)]
I miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]
(give me a second to gather my thoughts)
[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)

[Verse 4: Drake]
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive

"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah. Ho!
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

[Hook: Drake]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

[Hook: Drake x2]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

[Hook: Drake x2]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

Believe me baby, Stevie baby

"[Intro: Drake]
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Alternate Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop

This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down
This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

[Verse 1: Voyce]
Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way!!
Because I'm in and out of town, that's just how I got's to get down
But you understand, that's why I'm your man!!

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!

YEAH YEAH (Keep rocking to this beat)
UH, UH, UH (You want me to drop to this beat?)
UH, UH, UH (HO!)
YEAH YEAH (Let me get a little gospel on them. Yeah. Uh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't explain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

[Bridge: Voyce]
Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!",1

Hey, yo, Drake, you never answer your goddamn phone, huh? Pick up the phone, man. I know they got you running around, bro. Anyway, it’s all good with Socrates hooking you up, dawg. Hey, best wishes for this tape. I hope you take over the world. You know we gon' do it. You make sure you get me on there. You call me when you need that hook, you call me when you need that beat, you call me when you need that [hot 16], bro, and let’s put this whole mathematics together, dawg.

Yo, Drake. What up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don’t know why you’re not picking up the phone, you’re probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or will be talking to Tyra Banks whatever. But, yo, check it out, it’s your boy Keeyaga. I’m just calling to say what up, haven’t talked to you in forever, indefinitely. You know, we need to go, you know, downtown Toronto, kick it together and do what we gotta do, but, uh, I gotta, you know, get off the phone because I have, you know, Beyoncé, you know, Eva Mendes all on the other line. So, yo, do what you gotta do, and holla at your boy man. All the best. Peace",1
"[Intro: Nickelus F]
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day

[Verse 2: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, ""I expected this""
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy",1
"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But

[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigga""
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

[Hook: Nickelus F]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

[Hook: Nickelus F]",1
"[Verse 1: Drake]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

[Verse 2: Drake]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Chorus: (x4)",1
"[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, What up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrakk, what's popping baby?
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Uh, uh, uh

[Break: Drake]
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check

[Verse 2: Drake]
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, ""You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'""
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, ""Auntie, this is a safe career""
She said, ""Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here""

[Hook: Drake]
So I kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick Then push
And coast

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said ""There's no skating here""

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, uh
And push, yeah, yeah
And coast
Ah ha, Swanky",1
"[Intro: Piano Instructor]
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our annual recital here at the U.P.A., Urban Pianist Association. Here is the most talented student in my class, Aubrey Drake Graham. It has taken a long time for him to get to this point. Do not get me wrong, he’s not perfect, but he has come a long way since my meeting with his mother. He has made improvement! So Aubrey, show these people what you got man!

[Sidebar (to Drake): Piano Instructor]
Put the Jamie Foxx on them! I won’t be able to see you, but I will be able to hear you from outside, so, I’ll eat my Greek salad and drink that Grey Goose you gave me, mmmm! Anyways, good luck! Hey! Don’t mess up, okay? My ass is on the line!

[Piano Solo: Drake]

[Sidebar (to Drake): Piano Instructor]
Hey! What did I tell you about playing bad notes huh?! You’re a failure! Just leave and take your damn Grey Goose with you!",1
"[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna

Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[Verse 1: Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2: Drake]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice

She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist

Cuz they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin forward to seein woman that played you
And shittin on the men they get engaged to

We can discuss it further when yall manage to get here

But, they was inspired 'cause they knew they, they, they had somethin' to see the dream for, you know?
I done seen a lot of shit, I ain't never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
And then, when you've finally got the crib (All you do is lie to me)
You did it like, not even none of us did it, you feel me? Uhm
Nah, I mean I did it like that, I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie to you
I did it like that, but, I ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
How cats told me that he'd been inspired (All you do is lie to me)
And felt that feelin' in they gut, like ""I gotta work harder"" (Need more than a homie)
Well I mean workin' harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real
It's either you fuckin' in the game or you're out the game

"[Intro]
I don't care what you done, I don't care where you been
All you got do to is look over your shoulder
And look where God has walked you from
All you gotta do is look back
Just somebody look over your shoulder
Look where you come from, look where you come through
I come through the storms and rain
Look where I come from, I was down but now I'm up
Look where I come from, by the grace of God
By the goodness of God, look where I come from
Remind me where I'm from again (6ix)
Yeah, that's right, that's right
Tryna suppress the stress, you know?
Got a family tree that needs watering
A father that needs fathering
A mom that would probably prefer the whole mother-daughter thing, but we still rolling, you know?

[Verse 1]
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
They callin' my name, just another day
Can't bend, can't break
Can't let it show on my face
All of my mistakes, right there on display
All part of my story, skin thick as my shawty, yeah (Too thick shawty)
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
Is everybody safe? Carrying the weight
Tell me what it takes to get everybody straight
The money in my safe, can't buy a clean slate
Clean isn't for me anyway

[Interlude]
I don't want you to allow people to tell you that you are useless
Alright, alright, go ahead and tell 'em, go ahead and tell 'em
Because I want you to know, God told me to tell you this day ""You are useful"" (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
You are valuable (Yes), and you are vital (Yes), to God

[Chorus]
Vital, vital, on baby, on Bible
Remember what I left when I go
Remember what I said when I spoke
Please don't stand at my grave and cry though
I'm not there, they made it so I can never really die though
So please don't stand at my grave and cry though
Pop champagne, scream my words
Let me leave on a high note
And don't let nobody call me an idol
'Cause I was never sitting idle
And my people go where I go

[Verse 2]
Don't let nobody sell my house on the bridle
Worked too hard for the title
Worked too hard, where did life go?
Last thing I heard was Andre scream ""Ice cold""
Past eight years feel like I had my eyes closed, blindfolded
Smoke before I make my decisions
That's how I take the high road
Say I never get alone time, that's a lie though
I'm still alone with everybody as far as I know",1
"[Hook: Drake]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Drake: Verse 1]
Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone, (I I I)
I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it

My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby after you
I’ve had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am

[Hook]

[Drake: Verse 2]
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
Because everything's easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, still run the committee
NY forever nigga, Diddy

[Hook]

"[Verse 1: Drake]
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you

[Verse 2: Dawn Richard]
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question...

[Hook]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you

[Verse 3: Drake]
I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out

[Hook]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you",1

You gotta put up out the city, she can't get any closer

You gotta put 'em on, she like that

You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all of your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life

You should be movin' in silence

Need a better environment
I bought bags to fill up your closet
I pop tags, I know where I'm rounded
I do the dashes, get higher than the mountain
You need class to be with a celebrity
So sad, you lookin' like charity
What you wanna do? See niggas bury me?
All of my brothers are black, carry me
I can't answer you through the legacy
At the embassy speak, it was like therapy
Bought a Patek Philippe in your currency
Bitches can't keep it real with a nigga movin' so desperately
You the one that did the Twitter shit first to see how these hoes react
The only one that can make me feel some way 'cause I love you back
You wanna be my queen, niggas fuckin' on you, think I'ma take you back?
Your bags are secured at home, relax

I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me

You give but you cannot take love
I wish you could see
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?

You give but you cannot take love

Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin' my time

'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But you heard it all
Well I'ma say it anyway

I started believin' that crazy shit she told me
Not sure if that makes me crazy or just lonely
Then I got bored, because fightin' is boring
And she was gone soon as I started stallin'
I don't want it except for when I want it
And even then I beat myself up for it
That's when you hear me say I'm movin' on from it
But it's obviously something else that I want from it
And then that's how she goes about it
It's hard to act like you want it when you know you got it
I'm textin' and callin' like that's my true callin'
And the only time that she's really talking
Is when you she tells me about myself like that's what's important
Startin' things over nothin', that shit is overwhelmin'
Her main problem is she always think I'm up to somethin'
And, shit, talking 'bout it make me wanna fuckin' call her
Reverse psychology, whatever you call it
But to answer the question, yeah, I think we're happy
We're always reunited, that's a good thing, I guess
We're always startin' over, that shit always seems excitin'
I don't know, I guess it's yet to be seen
She's busy doin' her and I'm out here chasin' the dream
Honestly, we say a lot of things that we don't mean
Start happy, end happy, with the summer in between, slow motion

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh, the world is far from perfect
'Cause I only think of you (Yeah)
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything movin' in slow motion
It's movin' in slow motion (Oh)",1

Uh-uh, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I wanna be together, when they say that they know somebody better
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—
And girl, I know you got your spies, when they happen to catch me in a lie
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I'm sorry that I'm super late
I was drivin' here jammin' them Lil Boosie tapes
Understand that I do not envision, I hallucinate
I'm the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate, but
Let's talk about the babies me and you could make
We could do it anywhere, baby, you just choose the place
I hope I'm not being inappropriate
But maybe if I peak under the table, you could show me it?
Let me get a quickie, speed stick, no deodorant
To cover up the smell 'cause your parents are the nosiest
When you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
But even with a bunch of women, you could be the loneliest
I tend to ask more than I can give
Or wait whatever's next and just get bored of what it is
That's probably why I'm keepin' you around
Was looking for exactly what I found
I just hope you stay down

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Drake]
Babygirl, I hope you rep for me for real
And when they get to stereotypin' a nigga
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
Listen, even if you slightly doubt me
When these bitches start to writin' books about me
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Everything about me cataclysmic
Big, obscure on every characteristic
I don't know what you're used to, but I'm a little different
Tremendous with credentials, resume is so prolific
Enough of that, despite I'm promisin' one in the booth
Always been a specialist at messin' with the best forbidden fruit
Never did I witness beauty so amazin', get it to the point when I see her, she glowin' like an angel with it
But after all the years of doin' it, I need an understanding with a woman good with followin' my lead
And though she finds it sexy and she loves that I'm the power, even in a crowded room, discreetly touching on her private
And when we goin' through a moment when we feelin' iffy
Believe in shit you hearin' while I question if you with me
You see that line of chicks? Let's go around the corner, waitin' and hopin' you drown, I just hope you stay down
I can't help the women lovin' everything about me, why you passin' judgement?
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
I know it's hard to trust me, all this money got my baby mama tryna fuck me
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—",1

rap monster: yeah, so i started producing that song right after hearing fly!
suga: this suga-nim also started rapping after hearing that~
rap monster: itâs the exact same!
j-hope: itâs all the same
rap monster: so while we were listening to fly, what was our hobi hope doing?
j-hope: unlike everyone who raps, i was practicing my dancing!
jimin: right
v: oh, natural dancing skills?
j-hope: i bet jimin was doing the same?
jimin: of course i was! is there no one else here whoâs dreamt of dancing?
rm/suga/v: ... thereâs no one!
jimin: (laughing)
v: nobody, go away!
j-hope: thereâs no dancing!
jimin: one person...
rap monster: i just got static right now
jimin: no one? (laughs)
rap monster: i just thought everyone was worried
jimin: one second static!
suga: taehyung, taehyung, what was your dream?
v: i played the saxophone for three years.
suga: but why donât you do it anymore?
v: ahâ¦
jimin: saxophone?
v: because my mouth hurts...
bts: (laughs)
suga: your mouth hurts?
j-hope: (laughs) yeah, your mouth must hurt
rap monster: youâre really hypocritical
v: my mouth hurts
suga: your mouth must have hurt a lot
jimin: that's a huge reason
rap monster: my heart hurts hearing that
suga: our jin hyung, what did you want to do? hyung?
jin: me? i, like my dad, wanted to leave the house at 7am and come back at 6pm and eat whatever my wife cooked me.
j-hope: as usual
v: oh~ oh, really?
rap monster: yeah, i like that, it's the best!
jin: that's the best
rap monster: whatâs the use of hip hop? thatâs the best
v: what?
jimin: but you canât just throw away hip hop like that, hyung! (laughs) why did you do it? (laughs)
j-hope: youâve thrown away hip hop so coolly!
rap monster: donât insult my dad!
jimin: why are you throwing it away?
rap monster: donât, donât insult my dad!
suga: jungkook-ah!
jungkook: yeah? yeah? yeah? yeah?
suga: jungkook, what was your dream?
jungkook: me? ahâ¦ i canât remember wellâ¦

 i wanna big house, big cars & big rings
 but in reality, i don't have any big dreams
 haha i live an easy life
 even if i donât dream, no one says anything to me
 everyone is thinking the same as me
 when we were still young i said i'll go to some university
 okay, mum, i'm going to the library
 
 what is you that you dreamed of?
 who do you see in your mirror, i gotta say
 go your own way
 even if you live a day
 do something
 put weakness away
 
 why don't you say anything? you don't want to study

 disobey the hell-like society pardon the dream
 ask yourself 'bout the profile of your dream
 become the subject of your own life, away from suppression

i contemplate if i should click like or not
it repeats many times
your heart is like a guillotine
cutting me mercilessly
but, like a goblin, i secretly go to you
and watch your daily life
each time my mind gets filled with the 108 defilements
oh shit, do you think of me, do you?
as i contemplate, i decide not to click like

after we broke up you look better, pretty woman
yeah yeah yeah yeah

"ah-ah
trainee
in many ways, this term defines my existence
but at the same time it is a term that i can never truly explain
a period of time, a state of transition
where i could neither belong anywhere
nor do anything
the biggest concerns i had living as a trainee
were the questions of friends and family
""when are you going to come out?""
""when are you going to debut?""
questions like these
i couldnât give them an answer
because i didnât know either
because such answers were unknowable
though i came here through a certain confidence
and belief in myself
what awaited me was a different kind of reality:
even now, after three years have passed
even as i occasionally gain the self-certainty to think things like
âonce i debut, i will conquer the music industryâ
whenever i hear the criticisms of the producers and teachers
i am again overwhelmed by the realization that i am nothing
that i am as inconsequential as a speck of dust
itâs as if though before me lies the bluest ocean
and if i turn to look back
a vast desert awaits me
in this hourglass-like mindset
in this mood
i spent my three years as a trainee
and now, my debut is finally drawing near
even after i debut
new oceans and new deserts will likely await me
i am not afraid
because what has made me who i am
are the oceans and deserts i have witnessed until this moment
i will never forget
the oceans and deserts i have seen
because i am a trainee",0
"yeah, wassup
you know, time flows like stars
(check it, check, check, check, check it out)

it started with eminem, garion, epik high
i exceed imitation, i write my own rap then carve them in
somehow found myself at hongdae already
back then, my lyrics were all (****) stubborn old
but we dunno, we dunno, we dunno the future
allowed no time to breathe and tied me up while i was dreaming
the trap of an abandoned reality, oh the trap of oneâs youth
my fiery heart lost to my cold head (damn)
while i had blind faith that my choice was the right one
something that i canât identify as an angel or devil says
âwouldnât you like to rap properly?
yes or no, there is no time to hesitateâ
i, who didnât want to make an even bigger idiot out of myself
came to this place and 3 years have since passed
some say art is long, life is short
but now for me, art is life
life is sports
just do it, uh

would i have changed?
if i had chosen a different path
if i had stopped and looked back
oh hey ya, hey ya
what will i get to see?
at the end of this road
where you would be standing
oh hey ya, hey ya

countless measures of time have passed and itâs 2013
i remained a trainee for 3 years
iâve changed from a high school student
became an adult child, without knowing
grey hairs of greed and ambition increase
and the many friends i had split off one by one
lonely without family
i greet my third spring in seoul alone
i thought my worries will ease with the debut in front of my nose
i closed my eyes to the present that could not be altered
reality was different, even when my peers tried to help me
i walked the lightless tunnels on my own
i thought i was alone but iâve learned that we are seven
no longer barefoot, wearing shoes called bangtan
we go on forward another step, newer than the last
towards the fourth spring, weâll greet in seoul, woah

would i have changed?
if i had chosen a different path
if i had stopped and looked back
oh hey ya, hey ya
what will i get to see?
at the end of this road, where you would be standing
oh hey ya, hey ya

itâs the year 2010
my steps head to seoul
i, who started out just loving dance
is soon to stand on stage
until then i combat the many pains and scars and prepare myself
i nurture my notion to bend rather than to break
and run for 3 years
and ignite the stars in my heart
now see me anew
i carve âbangtanâ into a blank page that means the whole world
i walk towards my brighter future
i put on a smile for the further days, ha ha

would i have changed?
if i had chosen a different path
if i had stopped and looked back
oh hey ya, hey ya
what will i get to see?
at the end of this road, where you would be standing
oh hey ya, hey ya

would i have changed?
if i had chosen a different path
if i had stopped and looked back
oh hey ya, hey ya
what will i get to see?
at the end of this road, where you would be standing
oh hey ya, hey ya",0

i want to ask my father if he enjoyed his life

it's either number one or a failure

a factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle

adults say that we have it so easy
they say i'm on my way to happiness
then how do you explain my unhappiness?
there's no conversation topics other than studying
outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
who will take responsibility?

when it comes to pretty girls, thereâs no racism
european, asian, caucasian girls
(i have âem)
call rick owens, ann demeulemeester
alexander wang and shane oliver
iâll make them make
the kim namjoon collection forever
the color of the clothes would be black
now iâm finally pleased
music, turn it up
iâd pick my nose out of boredom
so iâll make a song and
make everyone on earth sing it
the title of the song would be âae gu gaâ
iâll be buried under pretty girls as i watch tv
all girls of the world would want me, ready to die
boys, bring me alcohol
or you can just disappear
anyway, this is my kingdom

if i ruled the world, sometimes, i dream
if i ruled the world, first iâll hire a real estate agent
and buy a house to live in with my family
yes, next iâll awaken my savings
and buy a four-wheel drive, put in some gas
even if itâs too much
iâll get it with zero-interest discount
stocks and gambling
i donât wanna do things like that
i rule the world so why would i dream small?
donât ask me that because
i still want to do music with my bts family
i will become the kim jung-un of the hip-hop world
and put a ban on everything but our music
i know itâs an unreasonable dream but itâs my dream
donât make fun of me

oh girl, where? oh god, here!
all the girls of the world are in hope world, lined up
even if i lightly spend all the money i want
money is put into the goalpost called my wallet
iâll fearlessly walk around the stage
even if i donât run, my mileage would still build up
i will soon gift myself with these dreams
iâll shout with the name of bts

"baby baby, youâre a caramel macchiato
your scent is still sweet on my lips
baby baby tonight
yeah

girl, i debuted, thatâs enough right?
i made a bet with the world on how much iâd succeed
my half-moon eye smile that i only showed you
iâm doing it again these days
my fans are curious
oh and i donât drink macchiatos
you know that i started drinking americanos because of you
when we dated, i wondered what kind of taste this was
but this cold and bitter aftertaste
makes sense now that youâre not here girl
if iâm gonna get used to everything like this
i would choose the full-of-regrets, playing with fire
our heartless promises
countless mistakes and other wrongs
our unspeakable and small wounds
the glass filled with memories is more bitter as i drink it
but i think i know why i keep drinking it
why am i getting so sad that everyone lives this way?
oh oh oh

baby baby, youâre a caramel macchiato
your scent is still sweet on my lips
baby baby tonight
yeah yeah yeah
baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
do you remember that feeling?
baby baby tonight
yeah

baby tonight, have a good night
our first text and phone call that
was filled with awkward moments
our highly anticipated first date
why did i bite my nails? why was i so nervous?
as time went by, we naturally developed into lovers
with those kinds of words
we checked each otherâs feelings
our first date was sweet like a caramel macchiato
wherever we went, we wanted to go together
but as time went by
those feelings went down like dripping down espresso
uh, my insides ache for no reason, uh we used to be so good
breaking up was like a bitter americano
my memories still go to that cafe

baby baby, youâre a caramel macchiato
your scent is still sweet on my lips
baby baby tonight
yeah
baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
do you remember that feeling?
baby baby tonight

1,2,3,4
the days when i used to be
intoxicated with your scent all day
i remember we chose to break up
after promising our futures together
as i drink this minty coffee that you
used to like, i think of you, rewind
a lot of time passed and these days
i sometimes miss you, i wonder why?

baby baby, youâre a caramel macchiato
your scent is still sweet on my lips
baby baby tonight
baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte

"damn the hip-hop pride, idol rapper? cut that bullshit
heâs essentially an idol shit anyway â they look down on me
they give their principles to the dogs and laugh at my name
you only know how to go with the tide
and look down on others, how you kill me?
so i bring the monster back
my monster swag
so this is the monster track
cuz of my freakin' monster rap
the modern day hong kil dongâs
they see good things but canât call it good
third-generation leader, so iâmma lead ya
this is a generation change â iâm sayin'

donât turn the beat off becuz iâm not freakin' done
donât play around on top of the beat
cuz every kick is my freaking zone
i was always generous
but now iâmma murder you rappers
cut em up by order
then iâmma murder you haters
now look at me and tell me, whoâs in your top 5?
rap monster, randa, leader, rapmon, your dad

right now itâs hope world from bts
everyone follows me, my potential gets retweeted
let everyone know my flow
ride your eardrums and fill your bodies
i sharpened my sword for tomorrow
get back in the days
considering my age, i was a kid who didnât know rhymes
i was just a common kid
from gwangju who looked at idols
now iâll show you, on the cypher on top of this track
iâll reveal my aspirations, iâm above the minors
itâs a major different from you, uh
i fill up the tv screen
rapper costume? no, i take away the foam and spit it out
whatever i want â wherever i go, it becomes an issue
if youâre jealous, go to the hospital, two weeks to heal
everyone who hoped for my defeat is holding onto their necks
j-hope plays a foul on top of the game that rides with
hip-hop pride

i have yet to go to the army but my hobby is sharpshooting
we are bulletproof was a big hit
the clumsy fakers was pricked and reacted
feel a little more inferior, the quality of my pronunciation is 4k
iâm dope man, iâm the chopin of the beat
i wonât ever change, i was born a rapper
my attitude is my mentor
even if you talk smack about me, iâm memento
show your hip-hop pride but youâll still feel impotent
hide your jealousy, i can see your ip address
iâm a boiler, i get hot in an instant
like a spoiler, youâre so typical
fixed up and stupid hip-hop losers with nothing inside
itâs too hard to last in this growing world of k-pop
so just rap as a hobby
itâs the end of the world, if youâre guilty, try harder, what",0

when it comes to satoori
kyeongsangdo is the best
itâs tasty and sounds good
perfect for our sentiment

hyung, we have that too â did you eat?
this bibimbap is the best
i havenât even started talking yet so
iâm gonna let it all out later

is that the guy? do you know this phrase?
kyeongsangdo is bad? who says!
what are you saying? kyeongsangdo is all

iâll just give it to you
weâre not strangers

skatefish to clear their minds

hey you country boys
i have a seoul state of mind
i was born in seoul
so i learned the seoul language well
although these days
satoori is highly regarded
yes, iâll admit it
the accents are pretty cool
but as much as
itâs the standard language here
itâs that much honest
the beginning and end
are clear and organized
as the example of a
well-built korean language
only ours goes with english
yâall never understand it
okay, iâll honestly become honest
kyeongsangdo accents
make guys want to use it
jeollado words sound so friendly
once i start to use it, i get all happy
why keep fighting
in the end, itâs all the same korean
look up, we are all
looking at the same sky

your breathtaking neck when you
put it up and the strands that fall out

and part when they wither
i didnât think iâd get over you easily but
is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
iâm still lying, saying that itâs all for you
you are standing in the center of my life

just one day, if i can be with you
just one day, if i can hold your hands
just one day, if i can be with you
just one day (just one day)

if you are and i are together, letâs go time
24 hours, if i could only be with you
iâd kiss you starting from the morning
canât forget to grab some brunch
iâd hold your hand and soak up the sun
itâs not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
iâll confess to you, with the moon as our light

"same day, same moon
24/7 every moment repeats
my life is in between
jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow
itâs funny, you think anything is possible when youâre a kid
when you feel how hard it is to get through a day
i keep feeling down like control beat gets downed
every single day is a repetition of ctrl+c, ctrl+v
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?
i scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
i hope tomorrow will be different from today
iâm just wishing

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, donât ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, youâre just taking a break
donât give up, you know
donât get too far away, tomorrow

donât get far away, tomorrow
donât get too far away, tomorrow

the tomorrow weâve been waiting for
becomes the name of yesterday at some point
tomorrow becomes today, today becomes yesterday
tomorrow becomes yesterday and is behind me
life isnât about living along but living through
as you live through, youâll disappear some day
if you keep spacing out, youâll be swept away
if you ainât no got the guts, trust
itâll all become yesterday anyway so whatâs the use?
i wanted to become happy and strong but why am i getting weaker?
where am i going? iâm going here and there but i always come back here
yeah, iâll probably flow somewhere, is there an end to this maze?
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?
i scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
i hope tomorrow will be different from today
iâm just wishing

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, donât ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, youâre just taking a break
donât give up, you know
donât get too far away, tomorrow

tomorrow, keep walking, weâre too young to stop
tomorrow, open the door, we see too much to shut the door
when the dark night passes, a bright morning will come
when tomorrow comes, the bright light will shine so donât worry
this isnât a stop but just a pause in your life for a break
turn up your thumbs and press play so everyone can see

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, donât ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, youâre just taking a break
donât give up, you know
donât get too far away, tomorrow

donât get far away, tomorrow
donât get too far away, tomorrow",0
"because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
all of the style and flow is because of bangtan

the kids who will lead the 21st century hallyu has started to play
we're seven wolves, gathering the lambs with a trap
we pull through all the broken rap from now on
we keep driving forward, giants on the beats
bangtan cypher right here, psycho right here
whoever's in the ring, we'll win, rap fighter right here
i'll say hi, you'll say bye, a burnt tire, we're different
fire, hot choir, captivating k-pop like psy
my rap is huge, i'll say right in your ear, bug that
our riots got successively stronger
don't need long explanations, just explain with a rap
bts, follow the leader, let's go now
what

i'm a rap wiper, a complete psycho, if i'm a dicer, then i have all the dice
cypher, if you're nice, i'm nicer
if you're pride, then i'm a chrysler, that means i'mma priceless
who are you to judge my rap? rapper?
this is one piece, i'm a whitebeard, you just have long beards like catfish, bucket
hehe haha, honk honk, 300 per hour
i'm going through the process of working hard
i won't discriminate but catch them all, tombstone, knock knock knock out
fire in the hole beat bing bing pow pow, you'll cry and look for your dad
my voice constricts the voices of the plain rappers at all times, like the pc cafe closing
this is a kingdom, i'm a king, you're dumb
i'm chew you and swallow, you're bubblegum
on top of the running man is the flying man
on top of the flying man is the one who rides on him
that's me, beat, a badder guy than rain
like rags, i just hang it up, after i play with it, i rip up your eardrums, boom boom boom
this is the curse of my dawn, a nightmare, a riot, serial murder, theft, doom doom doom
you're like a kakaotalk with no friends, no reason to look
did you already wet your pants? sorry, there's no bathroom
i'm commanding you, let go of the mic and get up
just do the ""chun"" because you have no ""shil""
i'll push you out because i really don't like you
i'm good at sewing, putting it into practice
i'm growling right now, you're in a bit of danger
just do the ""yeon,"" like i said, you have no ""shil""
rise and rise to the sky but get ripped, bucket, i've forgotten you
my voice, my hegemony, i made it from one to ten
i put the whole world on my tongue
i play with big boys, i ain't spittin low sh
on the cd or the tv, you can see me, envy me, it's a pity, gee gee
beat i'mma monster i rap with a prospect, yeah i rap with a mindset i'm a suspect
sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at? i'm da king, i'm the god so where ma emperors at?
i parachute on my neverland, i'mma peter pan, so this will never end
you know when i ride on my g5 you sit first class and satisfy and i keep giggling
keep gigglin, keep jigglin, bring yo booking mic beat, wanna have a go?
hyungs who are sick with pride and strange beliefs get lost after 8 measures
you old catepillars, i'll give you this beat, give it a try
hey, start talking when you can start rapping
there should be a law restricting you from rapping

because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
us three gather together and shout out a new generation
because of j-hope
because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
the next batter will rap on top of this beat

speech and action are like shackles, my crime is assault with my tongue
you're so bad ever since you were born
if you're gonna whine about this beat, just leave
look at the arrogance of the hip-hop con artists
when you were playing underground, bts was playing at ground level
compared to you who sleeps all night, i'm a workaholic, shoppaholic
overspending on my pens that are more in number than your fans, if i go all in and shoot, it's a goal in
goal in, i'm ballin, when i hear your rap, i'm about to throw up
my voice even bewitches your girlfriend
the studio is my playground, my partner is a pen and paper
you think being escorted makes you powerful, i hope you put down your mic
if i'm the sun, you're the moon, because when i rise, you go down
all you hip-hip designer brand bastards, come down from the foamy bubbles
hey you brats, your crappy rap is a burden to others
take a break and wait, just go to hawaii, go home
see how far i go, all the rotten roots will be replaced
everyone, let's play a game, without efforts, you'll just be grieving
you think you can do music? just go look for a part-time job
although your short and thin career will get you nowhere
i hope you survive, keep rotting away, that's your label
your life is like a mudfish, your rap is recycled
you save up and divide up the flow, write it up and use it again
hey beat, know that you're embarrassing, just with 24 measures, you lay down sick
compared to your size, your rap is so thin
like your parents, my heart hurts every time i see you
i'll put a period at the artery of your music career",0

you know bts is back!

with shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
with a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
the class system of the 21st century is divided into two
those who have and those who havenât
those who wear the shoes and those who donât
those who have the clothes and those who donât
and those who try hard to get those things
whatâs going on? are you falling behind on the trend?
you whined and complained to get it, did i strike a nerve?
in your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
even after seeing your parentsâ curved spines, youâre so coldhearted
you complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(ayo baby) stop being so immature
you wonât freeze just because you donât have that jacket
fill your head with good sense before itâs too late

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youâre something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
what is wrong with you? youâre crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

(la la la la la la la la la)
you are a spine breaker
(la la la la la la la la la)
your parentâs spine breaker
(la la la la la la la la la)
some day, youâll regret it
(la la la la la la la la la)
those damn spine breakers

whatâs up, kid? you donât know how good you have it these days
maybe iâm crossing the line for butting in other peopleâs lives
why do you keep saying those empty words?
iâm saying iâll spend my own money that i received
youâll only be satisfied if i spend my money like you spend yours
please go take care of yourself
itâs about your life, if you were me, i wouldnât say anything
yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(but i say) i really want it so what do i do?
friends who are poorer than me have it too
(and i say) i have no choice but to buy it if i donât wanna be an outcast
people my age are all like this
yeah i dunno, yes iâm loco, is it no-no?
i know they ainât cheap but they got mojos
but i do what i gotta do, i donât break my parentâs spines
the true breaker is you, who is old and stuck in your room

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youâre something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong
what is wrong with you? youâre crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me
everyone experienced it before
wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
everyone looks smaller than me like iâm gulliver
whatever you wear, i understand but youâre too much
youâre gonna regret it
you can keep your swag on but how about your parents?
fine, i wonât stop you but make a decision now

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youâre something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
what is wrong with you? youâre crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

youâre becoming an adult but i wanna rewind
to the times when the 10-year-old boy sang the theme song to his favorite superhero comic
i wanna go back so i close my eyes and scream
but nothing changes, reality is the same
no matter who tries to stop me
i will go on my way

2007 is when my life changed
itâs been 7 years since iâve sang
a killer of girlsâ hearts
but sometimes, i go back to those frustrating times
facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
that encounter awakens a different me
now iâll go up on stage
and surprise everyone by jumping like jordan
ball!
go back a few years
taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
you used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
letting myself go to the innocent dreams
my childhood days was impatient to be an adult
but each day was filled with joy
so can i be the one, just can i be the one
that i... stop

(letâs jump!) throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(letâs jump!) throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin up

letâs jump & down, we are here, we are bts
beat down, if youâre ready, put your hands up high
itâs different from what youâve dreamed of when you were little but we have met, weâre heroes, rappers in training
now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes
seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
instead of a trampoline, the place i need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
now donât just talk about it, itâs time to spread my wings and go, letâs get it started
spread your shoulders, rock your body, empty your head, letâs go party

your sexy mind and your sexy body
you were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
that makes me wanna party on your body
at the end of of your long, shiny hair
your gentle hips sing
youâre like a forest, shining inside the city
with that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
and i want you to be really really real for me
sometimes like my mom, sometimes youâre my energy
iâm an honest guy
iâm so nice on the outside that my enemies canât stop being honest
youâre so different from the normal people outside

a sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
even if you donât put on makeup
youâll put on your perfume called attraction
i never believed that there was a god
but now you make me believe because to me, youâre a goddess
whether youâre young or old, whether you have a hidden child
i donât care because i love you
if iâm with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
with you, i draw out my future
in between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers

like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type

playing mind games? two-timing? i donât know how to do that
but if youâre ever sick, donât call 911 but call me
tell me to cry, iâll cry, tell me to smile, iâll smile, tell me to roll around, iâll roll around

iâm getting nervous, iâm getting nervous
who are you? are you that great?
why do you keep teasing me?
just stop now, hold up, hold up

hold me tight before i kiss you
before my heart lets you go
say what you want

what is it that you really want?
hold me tight before i kiss you
before my heart lets you go
say what you want
say what you want
what is it that you really want?

i want to be your oppa
why donât you know my heart for you?
even if you ignore me
even if you act cold
i canât push you out of my mind
i want to be your oppa
i will be your man, just watch
so that my heart can touch yours
i will run to you right now

hold me tight before i kiss you
before my heart lets you go
say what you want

what is it that you really want?
hold me tight before i kiss you
before my heart lets you go

"girl, whereâd you come from?
what a mystery, where are you heading?
how old are you? are you older than me?
you arenât? then iâm your oppa!
(awesome) your face is so small and pretty
you look fresh like a salad, so smooth
have you eaten? iâm not just flirting with you
wanna get some coffee? is coffee okay?

pretty eyes, pretty nose, youâre so pretty
just looking at you makes me happy
but where did you come from? youâre so pretty
my heart is pierced by cupidâs arrow
anyway, youâre such a fair lady
any guy would fall for you after a first glance
i have to approach you before someone else takes you away
i will make my move on you first

where did you come from?

(oh) iâm so eager to know
so very curious to know

iâm from busan, and youâre from gwangju
but weâre alike
even here in seoul, even there in jeju island
everyoneâs in love, oh yeah

stop playing hard to get before i kick you in the butt
donât get me angry, before i change my mind
that guyâs no good, are you being like this because of him?
of course iâm mad because you like him instead of me
girl, are you kidding me? are you blind?
the world is full of guys like that
the guy only knows himself
my heart is all yours, i only know you

oh my, look what this girlâs doing to me
what sheâs doing is no joke
if you keep doing that, my heart will tremble
my hands will shake and iâll run out of breath
are you saying you like me right now?
is that how you feel right now?
i guess youâre interested in jeolla-do guys
oh right, where are you from again?

"yeah yeah
yeah just one, day one night

if only i had just one day
i want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
if thereâs a chance in my busy schedule
i want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
i like that, your long, straight hair
your breathtaking neck when you
put it up and the strands that fall out
wherever we go
my handbag is your waist
yo ma honey
whenever i see you i run out of breath like the streets of myungdong
our bgm is the sound of breathing
your voice when you say my name
i wanna be locked in you and swim in you
i want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
i appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
i imagine this all night every day
because itâs a meaningless dream anyway

just one day, if i can be with you
just one day, if i can hold your hands
just one day, if i can be with you
just one day (just one day)
if only we can be together

(do it do it do it)
i hope i can be with you for just one day
(do it do it do it)
having a party party with only you
(do it do it do it)
i hope i can be with you for just one day
(do it do it do it)
a party party with only you

if only i could do that, how nice would it be
if only we could go anywhere
to eat and watch a movie comfortably
i would do anything girl
iâm sorry
maybe iâm too rational
but still, if you see me someday, smile
maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
i know, i couldnât look at you more because of my dream
then just give me one day
even if itâs in my dream, just one day
out of all those words i had to swallow
because of the excuse of reality
iâll pick one and tell it to you for sure
letâs meet when the morning glory blooms
and part when they wither
i didnât think iâd get over you easily but
is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
iâm still lying, saying that itâs all for you
you are standing in the center of my life

just one day, if i can be with you
just one day, if i can hold your hands
just one day, if i can be with you
just one day (just one day)

if you are and i are together, letâs go time
24 hours, if i could only be with you
iâd kiss you starting from the morning
canât forget to grab some brunch
iâd hold your hand and soak up the sun
itâs not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
iâll confess to you, with the moon as our light
all of these things tell me
âif i have just one day, itâs possibleâ

just one day, if i can be with you
just one day, if i can hold your hands
just one day, if i can be with you
just one day (just one day)
if only we can be together

i hope i can be with you for just one day

just one day, if i can be with you
just one day (just one day)

can you please stay with me?",0
"same day, same moon
24/7 every moment repeats
my life is in between
jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow
itâs funny, you think anything is possible when youâre a kid
when you feel how hard it is to get through a day
i keep feeling down like control beat gets downed
every single day is a repetition of ctrl+c, ctrl+v
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?
i scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
i hope tomorrow will be different from today
iâm just wishing

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, donât ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, youâre just taking a break
donât give up, you know
donât get too far away, tomorrow

donât get far away, tomorrow
donât get too far away, tomorrow

the tomorrow weâve been waiting for
becomes the name of yesterday at some point
tomorrow becomes today, today becomes yesterday
tomorrow becomes yesterday and is behind me
life isnât about living along but living through
as you live through, youâll disappear some day
if you keep spacing out, youâll be swept away
if you ainât no got the guts, trust
itâll all become yesterday anyway so whatâs the use?
i wanted to become happy and strong but why am i getting weaker?
where am i going? iâm going here and there but i always come back here
yeah, iâll probably flow somewhere, is there an end to this maze?
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?
i scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
i hope tomorrow will be different from today
iâm just wishing

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, donât ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, youâre just taking a break
donât give up, you know
donât get too far away, tomorrow

tomorrow, keep walking, weâre too young to stop
tomorrow, open the door, we see too much to shut the door
when the dark night passes, a bright morning will come
when tomorrow comes, the bright light will shine so donât worry
this isnât a stop but just a pause in your life for a break
turn up your thumbs and press play so everyone can see

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, donât ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, youâre just taking a break
donât give up, you know
donât get too far away, tomorrow

donât get far away, tomorrow
donât get too far away, tomorrow",0
"because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
all of the style and flow is because of bangtan

the kids who will lead the 21st century hallyu has started to play
we're seven wolves, gathering the lambs with a trap
we pull through all the broken rap from now on
we keep driving forward, giants on the beats
bangtan cypher right here, psycho right here
whoever's in the ring, we'll win, rap fighter right here
i'll say hi, you'll say bye, a burnt tire, we're different
fire, hot choir, captivating k-pop like psy
my rap is huge, i'll say right in your ear, bug that
our riots got successively stronger
don't need long explanations, just explain with a rap
bts, follow the leader, let's go now
what

i'm a rap wiper, a complete psycho, if i'm a dicer, then i have all the dice
cypher, if you're nice, i'm nicer
if you're pride, then i'm a chrysler, that means i'mma priceless
who are you to judge my rap? rapper?
this is one piece, i'm a whitebeard, you just have long beards like catfish, bucket
hehe haha, honk honk, 300 per hour
i'm going through the process of working hard
i won't discriminate but catch them all, tombstone, knock knock knock out
fire in the hole beat bing bing pow pow, you'll cry and look for your dad
my voice constricts the voices of the plain rappers at all times, like the pc cafe closing
this is a kingdom, i'm a king, you're dumb
i'm chew you and swallow, you're bubblegum
on top of the running man is the flying man
on top of the flying man is the one who rides on him
that's me, beat, a badder guy than rain
like rags, i just hang it up, after i play with it, i rip up your eardrums, boom boom boom
this is the curse of my dawn, a nightmare, a riot, serial murder, theft, doom doom doom
you're like a kakaotalk with no friends, no reason to look
did you already wet your pants? sorry, there's no bathroom
i'm commanding you, let go of the mic and get up
just do the ""chun"" because you have no ""shil""
i'll push you out because i really don't like you
i'm good at sewing, putting it into practice
i'm growling right now, you're in a bit of danger
just do the ""yeon,"" like i said, you have no ""shil""
rise and rise to the sky but get ripped, bucket, i've forgotten you
my voice, my hegemony, i made it from one to ten
i put the whole world on my tongue
i play with big boys, i ain't spittin low sh
on the cd or the tv, you can see me, envy me, it's a pity, gee gee
beat i'mma monster i rap with a prospect, yeah i rap with a mindset i'm a suspect
sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at? i'm da king, i'm the god so where ma emperors at?
i parachute on my neverland, i'mma peter pan, so this will never end
you know when i ride on my g5 you sit first class and satisfy and i keep giggling
keep gigglin, keep jigglin, bring yo booking mic beat, wanna have a go?
hyungs who are sick with pride and strange beliefs get lost after 8 measures
you old catepillars, i'll give you this beat, give it a try
hey, start talking when you can start rapping
there should be a law restricting you from rapping

because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
us three gather together and shout out a new generation
because of j-hope
because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
the next batter will rap on top of this beat

speech and action are like shackles, my crime is assault with my tongue
you're so bad ever since you were born
if you're gonna whine about this beat, just leave
look at the arrogance of the hip-hop con artists
when you were playing underground, bts was playing at ground level
compared to you who sleeps all night, i'm a workaholic, shoppaholic
overspending on my pens that are more in number than your fans, if i go all in and shoot, it's a goal in
goal in, i'm ballin, when i hear your rap, i'm about to throw up
my voice even bewitches your girlfriend
the studio is my playground, my partner is a pen and paper
you think being escorted makes you powerful, i hope you put down your mic
if i'm the sun, you're the moon, because when i rise, you go down
all you hip-hip designer brand bastards, come down from the foamy bubbles
hey you brats, your crappy rap is a burden to others
take a break and wait, just go to hawaii, go home
see how far i go, all the rotten roots will be replaced
everyone, let's play a game, without efforts, you'll just be grieving
you think you can do music? just go look for a part-time job
although your short and thin career will get you nowhere
i hope you survive, keep rotting away, that's your label
your life is like a mudfish, your rap is recycled
you save up and divide up the flow, write it up and use it again
hey beat, know that you're embarrassing, just with 24 measures, you lay down sick
compared to your size, your rap is so thin
like your parents, my heart hurts every time i see you
i'll put a period at the artery of your music career",0

you know bts is back!

with shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
with a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
the class system of the 21st century is divided into two
those who have and those who havenât
those who wear the shoes and those who donât
those who have the clothes and those who donât
and those who try hard to get those things
whatâs going on? are you falling behind on the trend?
you whined and complained to get it, did i strike a nerve?
in your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
even after seeing your parentsâ curved spines, youâre so coldhearted
you complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(ayo baby) stop being so immature
you wonât freeze just because you donât have that jacket
fill your head with good sense before itâs too late

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youâre something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
what is wrong with you? youâre crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

(la la la la la la la la la)
you are a spine breaker
(la la la la la la la la la)
your parentâs spine breaker
(la la la la la la la la la)
some day, youâll regret it
(la la la la la la la la la)
those damn spine breakers

whatâs up, kid? you donât know how good you have it these days
maybe iâm crossing the line for butting in other peopleâs lives
why do you keep saying those empty words?
iâm saying iâll spend my own money that i received
youâll only be satisfied if i spend my money like you spend yours
please go take care of yourself
itâs about your life, if you were me, i wouldnât say anything
yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(but i say) i really want it so what do i do?
friends who are poorer than me have it too
(and i say) i have no choice but to buy it if i donât wanna be an outcast
people my age are all like this
yeah i dunno, yes iâm loco, is it no-no?
i know they ainât cheap but they got mojos
but i do what i gotta do, i donât break my parentâs spines
the true breaker is you, who is old and stuck in your room

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youâre something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong
what is wrong with you? youâre crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me
everyone experienced it before
wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
everyone looks smaller than me like iâm gulliver
whatever you wear, i understand but youâre too much
youâre gonna regret it
you can keep your swag on but how about your parents?
fine, i wonât stop you but make a decision now

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youâre something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
what is wrong with you? youâre crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

(la la la la la la la la la)
you are a spine breaker

2007 is when my life changed
itâs been 7 years since iâve sang
a killer of girlsâ hearts
but sometimes, i go back to those frustrating times
facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
that encounter awakens a different me
now iâll go up on stage
and surprise everyone by jumping like jordan
ball!
go back a few years
taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
you used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
letting myself go to the innocent dreams
my childhood days was impatient to be an adult
but each day was filled with joy
so can i be the one, just can i be the one
that i... stop

beat down, if youâre ready, put your hands up high
itâs different from what youâve dreamed of when you were little but we have met, weâre heroes, rappers in training
now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes
seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
instead of a trampoline, the place i need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
now donât just talk about it, itâs time to spread my wings and go, letâs get it started
spread your shoulders, rock your body, empty your head, letâs go party

the moment i first saw you
with short hair and a pretty school uniform
i only remember that image
you canât go anywhere
you have to only look at me too
i donât know why my heart is like this

"come here iâm bout to take u higher
we about to set this love on fire
iâve never felt like this before
my mom couldnât even stop me
i told you how i really felt
and in the end, i won
baby you should know you change
all of my negatives to positive
you put up your thorns
but i can see youâre a rose
whoâs making my heart race again
the person is you
i still donât know but
iâll make you know everything about me
i want to be your oppa
i want to be recognized differently than the other dudes
it might seem like a typical line from a movie
but i have a sixth sense
yo iâll be different iâll be missin'
iâll be kissin' ya all the time girl
i can take my eyes off you but i canât take my heart off you
now this is the beginning, iâm yo pocket monster
you gave me your heart and i gave you all of mine
today is happier than yesterday
but why, but why

why am i finding an excuse to call you like iâm a sinner
itâs worse than before we started dating
it is not enough that we are a couple?
you always give short answers like yes, iâm sleeping, no
your messages donât exceed 10 bytes
youâre like a goalkeeper who has lost her will
iâm like messi, running all over the place
i knew this wasnât from the start
a fair game
itâs not that i wanted to win over you
but i didnât want to keep losing either
even if weâre not couple-y and affectionate
i want to link arms with you like everyone else
and comfort each other and really mean it
whatâs best for each other
the fact that you have a dry personality, i understand
because iâm always below you, under stand
itâs like iâm carrying you on my shoulders
i canât do anything
my bitter smile has become a habit at some point
and you say you donât like me but you donât hate me either
am i rushing things? but if itâs not it, itâs not it
i have a partner in this puppy love
i just want to freely love
hold me, this is like a game
of tug-of-war without an opponent what you say

ah, baby donât you play
even if youâre a fiery road, iâll firmly walk on it
so please, donât look at me as if
youâre looking at a stranger
when i was nothing to you
i keep thinking about those times
what am i to you girl what am i to you
i do love you crazy, uh, do you?
like this and like that, stop confusing me
if youâre gonna keep this up, letâs write up a contract
x number of kisses per day, x number of texts per day
if we do that
will i feel better?
what am i to you girl what am i to you
i do love you crazy, uh, do you?",0

youâre in danger

does your phone work right? really?
am i really your boy friend? iâm sick of this!
why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
is it like a business relationship for you? or do you hate me or what?
don't don't dig it, don't don't
please be more affectionate! i pray for it again today

we are like parallel lines. we are so different though we both are looking at the same place
you are the only one that i got inside but i feel like that iâm outside of you

i am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
you are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

i always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
want you. want you. uh~ i want you
you are trickster. you are a criminal who shook my heart..
i had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
my one-way proposes are waste of time
if i was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. iâm such a love loser

hormones

women are like an equation, us guys are the solution (yup)
wear them more, your high heels
iâm 18, i know what i need to know
that women are the best in the world

youâre not mine but youâre the best
my body twists and turns in front of you

i want to approach you but youâre seriously too beautiful

women are the best...
  best gift, best gift
my one true wish is
  only you, only you

i donât care about women iâll hang out with once and say goodbye
but i learn when i see you, body 101
(it actually says body architecture as a movie reference, not body 101. )
my testosterone heavily shows up
after winning a war of hormones
iâll do some research, your existence is against the rules, a foul
if the standard of beauty is in the ocean, youâre the deep ocean
a mini cultural asset that should be taken care of on a national level

her hair, body, waist, legs, even her other unspeakable parts
if anyone says heâs not interested in them, iâd be surprised as a man
the tiniest gestures make me lose it
girl, your temptations make me sit at my computer every night. (looking at her profile)
for her, itâs lady first
women are like cold ice mountains? let it go
a female that drives me crazy, provoking me every day
after fighting my hormones again today, iâll pop my pimple

(hello hello) (what!)

tell me what you want right now

"people wonder why we love this h-i-p h-o-p, shit
why we got so much guys in this culture, tell me

it was a new world
i didnât think much of writing or poems
but it came to me suddenly like shim chung
i used to be a flightless bird but it opened my eyes
but people keep askinâ baby
why you love that hiphop shit?
then i tell them, i donât have a reason
itâs cause itâs hip hop
nothing special, epik high
just like others jay-z, nas
and of course the classic illmatic and doggystyle
in my mind, krs-one
and ready to die, eminem
and the chronic and the next classic 2001
gang starr, black star, eric b
rakim, pete rock and cl smooth
they juss keep poppin
thatâs all i listened to
i was like an old lady
i had so much to say that it
wasnât enough with what other people told me
first, i forced it
layer after layer, calling it lyrics
and that was it! uh that was it
when i became me
on the white paper in between my textbooks
i put myself
and i erased it, emptied it
i was free on top of the beat
seven years ago or now
itâs the same, this is the most me

iâll be down for your rap
iâll be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life
(hip! hop!) yeah this ma (hip! hop!)

yo ma hiphop enrollment?
i felt it with my body as i entered
boogaloo, king tut, old school rhythms
entrusting the beat with rhyme and my tongue
it shows its prominence, itâs rap dance time
yeah ma role model
dynamic duo, verbal with epik high
iâm still inexperienced as i write my resume
breaking down my namelessness, flying on stage
they helped me get up when i didnât know anything
the artist, ring that rang through my heart
expressing it with their bodies, biggie, 2pac, nas
i found out more about myself
hope hope world
before i made my own world, cole world
ever since he shone on friday nights
i got inspiration and wrote my songs
mac miller, kanye, kendrick
their music hits my ears
the best musicians that affixed
my lifeâs borders that went crazy every day
endless diction, all right, my instincts choose
whatever rap it is, whatever dance it is
my response is sensual
now my life melts with hip hop
today, iâm wild for the night, my body
feel like a$ap a$ap

iâll be down for your rap
iâll be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life
(hip! hop!) yeah this ma (hip! hop!)

hip hop has found me
just like a child looks for his mother
it came into my life naturally
i was just an elementary student back then
i set up my dream then
i want a rapstar, as others
i hated living the same, the prematurity of a little kid
even if people hold me down and warn me
hip hop persists in me
and completely turns me inside out
the young me used to write
my 16 bars on the corner of my textbooks
thanks to that, i threw away my secure life
and went to a studio in namsan-dong, daegu
all night, i sharpened my blunt pen tip
at the end of my efforts
instead of having a language marks for school
i filled up my rhymes
which made my dreams come true
everyone asks me, what is hip hop?
then i confidently answer, my everything
as a result, my life has buried itself into music
if loving this culture is a sin
iâll die over a hundred times

iâll be down for your rap
iâll be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life

"on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that itâs over, let me know

suddenly, rain wells up in my eyes
you well up, i see you even when i breathe
love blooms like cherry blossoms but burns and becomes ashes
hey girl i know, the conclusion you made by yourself
your hand, your body, your body heat that was hotter than the equator
iâm still here, on repeat on top of the disappeared tune
iâm turning by myself on top of this music that has ended

on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that itâs over, let me know

girl let me know
girl let me know
although i already know everything is over
just so no regrets are left behind
girl let me know
girl let me know
girl let me know
tell me something
i just wanna know
i just wanna know
my lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
so please tell me something, girl let me know

the promises we made disappeared with the time we spent together
the dominos have fallen with our breakup
like juliet and romeo
did i like you too much?
the heat between me and you wonât cool down
now i look back at the film with you
too early to do anything by thinking of you
you took away my stars at night, my sun at day
only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
if there are hellos, then thereâs bound to be goodbyes? never ever
i donât care about that, i donât want to stick to that
iâll turn away, hypnotizing myself

on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that itâs over, let me know

although i already know everything is over
although youâre over me
girl let me know
girl let me know
girl let me know
tell me something
i just wanna know
i just wanna know
my lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
so please tell me something, girl let me know

maybe weâre all just a bunch of fools
everyone lives with a love that has come to an end
itâs not that i still have feelings for you
i know we canât work out
but why does it feel like iâm having indigestion?
as if my insides will explode, cries come up my throat, making me throw up
in my imagination, i fight with you, make up with you and understand you
your hand gestures, your eyes, they are faded but not gone
why wonât it go away?
why wonât it go away?
why wonât it go away?

girl let me know

although i already know everything is over
although youâre over me

"(the thick color of a rainy day in seoul)
the racing cars, the squirming umbrellas all over the place
itâs cloudy and the air is clear
(the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle)
with a light gray background, why am i standing here?
i donât know if i have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all
i wake up when itâs just about to get bright outside
i brush back my hair when my exhausted hands
the memopad with the song i couldnât complete last night
iâll finish it today as i shut my eyes and let out a sigh
what excuse can i give? i try to make something up
itâs unfinished anyway so iâll just make anything up
then i turned my eyes to the window and everything looks gray
gray city, gray buildings, gray roads, gray rain
everything in this world is slow
my younger sibling who woke up keeps talking back
i keep opening and closing the innocent refrigerator
with the unknown empty feeling that washes over me
i think that i should just go outside
without even an umbrella
i can clearly hear the rain hitting the earth
i smile, itâs the best background music
like a crazy guy, i start to hum
i wonder what time it is
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still canât fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
itâs a rainy night, the rain knocks on my window, it hits my heart
with my sore shoulders, i look at my phone and see a text, âhow are you these days?â
my friendâs text gets my emotions going
as i inhale the scent of the wet rain, i stretch and go to the bathroom
then i greet myself, half asleep in the mirror
i have no one to meet but i take a longer shower than usual
rain is still falling outside the house
i have no where to go but i take my umbrella
and walk outside without a plan
as if the rain wants its existence to be known, my shoes get dirty
am i someone who engraved my existence to you like the rain?
if not, am i just someone who came and went like a rain shower?
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still canât fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
i get up and when i feel sore, i look out the window
as if it knows how my body feels, the rain is falling
as i look at the raindrops welling up in the window, i felt it
the tears that were flowing down my heart
with that strange feeling, i look outside and it looks like my situation
the rain that falls like a melody makes everything seem andante
i get ready and leave, opening the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face
as i walk, the moment i heard the rain
i wondered who this rain was falling for
a sound that hits against the lonely gray cement
come slow down
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still canât fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
even when this rain stops, when the clouds go away
i stand here, just the same
without saying anything, looking at the world
there, a not so beautiful me is looking at myself
in this rain

whatever you do i will kill for
whatever i do i'll be real for
look closely, this is the beast mode you wanted
when men smoke, and women smoke wind, i smoke beat
this a beat smoke
who the man told you crazy?
who the fella told you crazy?
i'm better than ya lazy
rather than those who do hip-hop through the keyboard
i live a hundred times harder
they look at rap easily genre, too many generals
uncertain, ambiguous all of them have some manners
those who can't even continue on one verse
because they try to discuss rap or music
that's why here they all still rap the same way like this
only three or two words, they're all critical patients
mother-father aphasic patient all just con artist
back yourself and look at the mirror
if you want to be a piece, make it an original
just try something suckas the sincerity in this is zero
i got by the name of monster welcome to the monster plaza
this a cypher i'm a rider imma ride it like a biker
oh shit slip it backwards beat
you're a drain and i feel content
the kids whose skills are on strike
do so much protest behind my back
man what you afraid of, i'm confident on top of the beat
you're a beggar, from your pocket to the skills you don't have, you're poor
i don't need givenchy cause i'm a star
i don't need hugo already a boss
i'm not buddha but i'm a butcher i cut away your flesh like a
change your iphone
you donât need your airplane mode
my roaming fees are hundreds of dollars
and you know i can take it more
make money with rocks, sell rocks, you frauds
san paulo to stockholm, places you'll never sit in your entire life i sit

haters i have a lot but no problem, i kill
the shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
bitch i don't care, you can't control my shit
i became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again

this fourth albums focus point cypher
when this track comes out haters will totally turn from the worse
on this scene that's about illegal things
this songs legality will make everyone fall into a trap
hang hang over bang
explode and come out swag
whenever i go, i drive straight
and wherever i go, it's there the losers of hip-hop
they're at a different proportion of levels to be cussing at me
busy by my talking has come, all unnies call me beep beep
someone's cussing at me
tell them to look at their own situation and then come to me
i don't have anything to be jealous of about others
oh on top of the beat beat i wiggle wiggling jingle jingling
i roll, roll around, act like a beagle, then i start to burn up
strength right now right now
ruling over on top of the on top of the ring
a king who will surpass the name of a god
this is just a sample, just a snack
my rap will soon be a korean meal to fill your stomach
that's right, my nation korea
all the rap mansiks' trying to spit out poor english
look at who's on top of you now

haters i have a lot but no problem, i kill
the shovels digging on my career in order to bury me

when i walk in the streets, they whisper my name
from daegu to apgujeong my beat that have been laid
the lives of my music that breath and live here and there all over the world
iâm a baby shaman who dances on the jakdu called the beat, thatâs me
my self that is shown through the tv
did you know that half of it is a kagemusha?
you're all just big talk with your mouth, but that's rapping
the spirit of my heavy king rap that hits towards the lies of the solicit nompaengis
rappers who act arrogant
my flow job that takes them all and toys around with them
if you try to damage me with simple words like that
i only become stronger
the mysterious me is a bulgasari who grows by eating your jealousy and envy
like you all know my voice turns people on
whether it be men or women
my flexible tongue movements will send them to hong kong with my raps
on top of the food chain
i'm always on the highest point of the summit
my idiocy that won't end
even if someone tries to try to fuck me over from the back
while you guys play around
we're going around the world
hyungnims who gained age carelessly
from my standards, you're at the level of a kid too
even if i'm wack or if i'm fake if i'm this or that
i'm the new standard of the music industry

saying this is so hard, i like you
i was too shy to become your sun so i became a cold moon
but afterwards, i keep making a wave of blankets on top of my ocean bed
i jump around like a crazy guy
winning over my embarrassed feelings with some ufc moves
with a high kick and a jab and a hook
with some pounding, i let it all out in my blanket

pulling on my chains again cause time flowing fast
(still everyday) bang it bang it, bang it bang it
(still everyday) bang it bang it, bang it bang it
at the blink of an eye, i went to grade 2
i only chased my dreams but now iâm setting the stage on fire
(still everyday) bang it bang it, bang it bang it
(still everyday) bang it bang it, bang it bang it
nothingâs really changed baby, itâs my second year of kpop
iâm still 181 baby, only my heart grew taller
iâm the first in my class baby, i even got the rookie award
going around the halls, i even get greeted by new juniors
i think i know whatâs going on now, rehearsals going smoothly
i have juniors a year below me and i think iâm doing well now
ahh, shit but i see seniors five and six years above
(hello!) now i realize, iâm still far away
teachers didnât give pressure last year
saying that iâm just a rookie and that itâs okay
they sat me down and taught me how cold the world is
with a few subjects
bias, negative comments, double standards, smack talk and disinterest
teacher, do we have tests for this too?
if i get first place, will i be a successful artist?
thatâs good too but i wanna do music
iâll just do what i want for now so leave me alone
work it out work it out 24 hours
burn it up burn it up, burn up every moment
put back your worries
even after a year, we live for today

iâm already in my second year (oh no)
at the blink of an eye, time is so fast (go go)
work hard play hard right
a year passed like a miracle bye
but what to do? iâm getting worried
i might be a bit more comfortable but thereâs still so much to learn
every time i get a break, the teacher keeps nagging
âyou need to take the test!â
what do you mean test
teacher, we are human too
just nod along, nod
letâs push everything back today and go tease the juniors
iâll go to the pc cafe today, i canât sleep
work it out work it out 24 hours
burn it up burn it up, burn up every moment
put back your worries

a second year rapper, put a score on him
fortunately, i put up a good defense
iâm still a child, i kept running but am only in my second year
like gulliver traveling between strangeness and reality
i donât care about others, iâll just go with the flow
bring all the losers with bias to me
looking back makes my blood dry up
shut up, iâm in my second year, the starting point of a new era
hide carefully or else youâll see past my tricks
whether youâre a senior or junior or teacher, get the out
at the blink of an eye, i went to grade 2

your finger that held me, that white finger
i thought it would last forever
but you changed as time passed
your words and face turned so cold
our relationship kept going around in place
i didnât say anything but i knew
that there was no more room for me in your heart

"the rim looks farther away today
sighs are building on top of the court
the boy is afraid of reality
but his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball
throwing the ball by himself
what iâm shooting at the rim
are my countless thoughts and worries
i pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready
shoot, the court is my playground
with my movements, a small ball bounces next to my feet
the results are as low as the floor
but i just shout out loud to the world that everythingâs gonna be alright
but the world gives me fear, then just stop
thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball, i throw my future
because of the otherâs standard of success
my worries spread like cancer again, god damn it
along with the thrown ball, laughter starts to spread
my breath rises to my chin, my dreams squirm about
the dribbles get faster, my heart gets happier
this moment feels like itâll last forever but the sun is setting
when the night comes again, reality gets destroyed
when i snap out of it, iâm just a scared idiot again
i keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality
others are running ahead but why am i still here?
breathe or dream
row the oars along with your heartbeat
if you are trapped in the otherâs thin judgements
then the sun will set on your life like a court
what am i doinâ with my life
this moment wonât ever come again
iâm asking myself again, am i happy right now?
the answer is already there, iâm happy",0

"i empty my drink but it gets filled with loneliness
i shouldâve just given in, why did i argue all the time?
even the trash bag thrown away on the street makes a lonely sound in the wind

you and i are like cell phones, when weâre apart you know weâll be broken

open my closed heart, drench my heart
so i can feel you, hold me

your arms, your warmth, your heart
i want to see it all, i beg you
this moment, even the warm flower scented wind
even the sky without a single cloud
everything feels cold and iâm even scared of the clear sky
if youâre not here, iâm just a corpse, so how can i breathe?
it hurts, iâm always cry cry cry
iâm going crazy, exhausted without you
i think of you without stopping
i hate it all, i hate every single day
it makes me cry, ring ding dong
if thereâs a chance, iâll catch you

"ayo suga
i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other peopleâs things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
letâs not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
letâs not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

letâs move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letâs move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that weâre about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe thatâs why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
thereâs more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now letâs take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after youâre done, letâs get a bowl of black bean noodles, thatâs right

letâs move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letâs move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my momâs heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so iâm gonna move again
iâm gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

letâs move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to

everyoneâs afraid of changes
staying, moving on, staying, moving on
we keep repeating the same things again and again
i guess thatâs life, iâm afraid
old or new, new or old, that isnât really important
whatâs important is, that we still breathe and live in the same place
so letâs move on",0
"that long night seems to be only flowing as it follows you
this time seems to be fading as it follows you

why are you getting farther away?
so far that i canât reach you?
tell me why, youâre so far away, why
canât you see me in your eyes anymore?

love is painful, something painful yeah
it seems that goodbyes are painful, something more painful

without you, i don't think i can be

"i only look forward and run
without having time to look around
without me noticing, i have become the pride of my family
and i have succeeded to some extent
they say teenage years mess you up
i think of it suddenly
at that time i was young
and had nothing to fear
a few times defeated isnât much
if thereâs anything thatâs different itâs my height
and also being a bit more mature for my age
from the underground workplace in namsandong
my beat has been laid out until apgujeong
the origin of youth
everyone said it, donât go overboard
if you act as if youâre a know-it-all and will be making music
you will make your home go broke
from that point onwards, i didnât care
no matter what anyone said
i only lived how i wanted, guided by only my beliefs
in your eyes, how do you think iâm doing right now
how do you think i am
i want to ask the several people who prayed for me to screw up
does it seem like my home is going broke, you bastards?

i donât give a shit i donât give a fuck
like i always said hundreds of time every day, ânever mind meâ
i can have a taste of failure and frustration and bow my head
we are still young and immature, donât even worry about it
moss surely grows on a stone that doesnât roll
if you canât return, go straight through your mistakes and forget them all
never mind
itâs not easy but engrave it onto your chest
if you feel like youâre going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
come on

never mind, never mind
no matter how thorny the road is, run

never mind, never mind
there are lots of things in the world that you canât help
you better

never mind, never mind
if you feel like youâre going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
never mind, never mind
weâre too young and immature to give up, you idiot
never mind

if you feel like youâre going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot

"yeah, the most lonely creature in the world
eh, do you want to know my story?
iâve never told this to anybody
yeah, come on

in the middle of the vast ocean
one whale speaks softly and lonelily
the fact that no matter how much they shout, it wonât reach
makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
of course i donât care whatâs the matter or what iâve now become
when loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
iâve become completely alone. it's a lock that fills sadness
someone says, âbastard, youâve become a celebrityâ
oh fuck that! so what?! nobody remains by my side and i'm fine on my own
these words that are easily said towards me quickly becomes a wall
even loneliness turns into something you can see

even if my breaths are blocked
because iâm confined in that wall
(i) head towards the surface of water above
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnât have a response
reaches tomorrow

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
an endless signal will reach someday
everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
even the blind whales will be able to see me
today i sing again

the world will never know
how sad i am
my hurt is water and oil that canât mix
so only above the surface of the water do i
breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends
a child in the lonely ocean
i want to make it known too
my value, everyday
i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never endâ¦ why is there no end and always hell?
as time goes by, itâs a neverland in a cold abyss!
but i always think, now
even if i sleep a shrimpâs sleep, my dreams are like that of a whaleâs
the upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday
like me, ye iâm swimminâ

i go towards my future
that blue beach and
believe in my hertz
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnât have a response
reaches tomorrow

mom said the sea is blue
she said to let out your voice as far as you can
but what to i do? itâs so dark here and there are only different whales speaking entirely different words!
i just canât hold it, ma! i want to say i love you
alone, i look back at this music sheet thatâs like a rotating song
this ocean is too deep
still, iâm lucky
(no one besides me knows of these tears.)
iâm a whalien

lonely lonely lonely whale
lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?

until this song that doesnât have a response
reaches tomorrow

"he's always late, should i say something?
  ah, say something
  say something in behalf of bangtan
  right, right
  i'll say something for the leader-hyung
  hey, hey! stop coming late!
  right, right
  (knock on the door, bell rings) hey! jung hoseok! jung hoseok!
  he's here
  go open the door
  say something
  seriously we need to say something
  say something what? what
  he's here, he's here
  jimin-ie is going to say something
  hyung, i thought about it but don't you think that you've gone over the line a little?
  what is? what? what?
  don't you think you're coming a little too late these days?
  wow, what are you saying?
  i personally think that is completely understandable considering he's the leader
  lol
  am i not human?
  why are you being like this to me?
  who do you think you are?
  ugh, i'm so tired
  namjoon-hyung is leader-hyung, he gets privileges
  exactly, the leader suffers so much
  leader-hyung suffering, (mumble mumble)
  i'm sorry, i think i'm the wrong
  i'm sorry we're (v & jimin) are same age friend as well, ugh
  yeah, things are hard for me these days, ah my shoulders hurt
  we've finished now
  is your shoulder right?
  ah, i don't know
  wow, i almost feel asleep while washing up
  i don't know why but i feel like that is possible
  yeah, you did that the other time
  hey, but kids
  just like sitting on the ground or something
  when i saw before v looked like he was going to die maybe that's why he wasn't singing?
  but i surprisingly get a lot of motivation support from v-hyung
  quit it
  lol
  ah, seriously stop being like that
  yeah you looked like you were having a rough time
  ah i said stop it
  you must have had such a hard time
  ah! seriously!
  not doing the dance properly as well
   yeah
  but seriously today ''i need u'' was so great
  dope! dope! it was awesome!
  oh yeah dope! dope was the best
  okay, yeah, they're all great but, don't you think ""danger"" was a killer?
  danger
  okay, but with ''i need u'', i can't even imagine how would it have been like if the ''i need u girl'' bit wasn't in it
everyone sings along to it, ''i need u girl'' you know that bit
  suga-hyung wasn't even like rapping at the beginning
  yeah, yeah, suga wasn't
  suga-hyung wasn't rapping at all
  he was just like holding the microphone
  suga-hyung was just doing stuff like this
  hey hey hey, i'll just say one thing
  he's really just half-assing it
  please just piss off
  lol
  if you don't even want to do that
  you just wanted to say that didn't you?
  that means that your voice didn't come out in ''i need u''
  it came out well, that's for sure
  i felt good, though, to be honest when suga-hyung didn't rap but everyone sang along anyway
  okay but imagine this
  there were so many people there as well and it just felt so good
  we just opened our eyes but we're practicing for ''no more dream'' in the training room, how would you feel?
  no, no, i'm not going back
  no them, i'm just to go down a different path
  yep okay, you do down another road
  that's it, you are doing ''no more dream'' right now only eating chicken breast
  no no no no, i can't
  you are with that cold argilla chicken breast
  seriously the manager-hyung. what about the scene where you secretly tried to have salt with the chicken breast and got
caught?
  oh no, no no no no
  my perm hair
  like seriously, this is just like all a dream and ''i need u''.  ''i need u '' is all a dream
  but seriously
  but sometimes it does seem like a dream
  but it's not just that
  don't say things like that!
  back in the day i used to eat world cone but now i'm doing world tours
  ah fainting, ugh okay
  what is that
  your sense of humor had significantly dropped
  these things get cut out immediately
  with one song
  okay but seriously, this could all be a dream, like to be honest there were lots of artists that did well in korea
  that's true
  i always think you should do well with one song first then go further but i'm a little bit anxious because it's not like our title song has come out yet or anything
  that's true
  ah this kid has a talent in bringing down the mood
  suddenly... it's almost like the titanic
  yep
  right before it sinks
  it's been overthrown
  ah, yoongi-hyung just happens to say something like this, really bursts the bubble
  i know right
  ""the title hasn't even come out yet''
  i know right, ''the title songs hasn't even... ''
  no wait! okay, so the title just has to come out well, right?
  yeah
  yeah then just like make it well, huh? release it and boom it will be a hit again. so easy amirite?
  lol
  hey you should just go to bed
  yeah, you suit being asleep better
  you usually don't say anything
  at this point i want to ask hobi, say something about your expectations for our music this time round
  hobi, what do you think?
  i think we'll do well
  lol
  noo
  lol shut up shut up you guys are so loud
  yeah we're not going to do well
  but kids, our youth is bright
  oh ya
  when we go to korea! bang-pd-nim will have prepared incredible tracks for us
and us? we just have to add our talent on the top of it!
  why are you being like this?
  we can say no no to our worries
  ah but worries
  hahahaha
  why why why
  okay but the reason why i think we don't have to worry is that, even today we performed in front of 5000 people",0

just falling without strength, my love

seem like theyâre looking at us
if i touch your hand, even if itâs all at once
it seems like itâll all become crumbs
i only looked
with the autumn wind
your words and expressions that become cold at some point
i can see that our relationship is fading
an empty relationship like the autumn sky
an ambiguous difference compared to before
today of all days, the much quieter night
one leaf left clinging to a branch
itâs shattering, i see the end
dead leaves becoming dried

youâre still green to me

lingering feelings hung out piece by piece like laundry
only crimson memories fall
from above me
even if my branch doesnât shake
they constantly fall

in order to rise
even when youâre near, my two eyes
are far away, itâs happening

please donât fall
never never fall
donât go far away

why canât i give up on you yet
i hold on to these faded memories
is this greed?
i try to look back on these lost seasons
i try to turn back

burn them brightly, whoosh
it was all beautiful, right, our path
but theyâve all faded
dry leaves come down like tears
the wind blows and everything grows apart all day
the rain is falling and youâre shattering

even if itâs a vain dream, stay like this a little more

as if thereâs no such thing as tomorrow
as if thereâs no such thing as a ânext timeâ
right now, in front of my eyes, everything without you
is a terribly pitch-black darkness

i say it like a habit
we wonât work in the end
even so, i keep hoping
as long as iâm with you in the end as well, iâm okay

even if i knew already
i canât stop
no way no way no way
as time passes
it just becomes more ruined
no way no way itâs collapsing again

even though the end is visible
even if itâs going to collapse soon
a house made of cards, weâre like idiots
even if itâs a vain dream",0
"the rim looks farther away today
sighs are building on top of the court
the boy is afraid of reality
but his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball
throwing the ball by himself
what iâm shooting at the rim
are my countless thoughts and worries
i pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready
shoot, the court is my playground
with my movements, a small ball bounces next to my feet
the results are as low as the floor
but i just shout out loud to the world that everythingâs gonna be alright
but the world gives me fear, then just stop
thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball, i throw my future
because of the otherâs standard of success
my worries spread like cancer again, god damn it
along with the thrown ball, laughter starts to spread
my breath rises to my chin, my dreams squirm about
the dribbles get faster, my heart gets happier
this moment feels like itâll last forever but the sun is setting
when the night comes again, reality gets destroyed
when i snap out of it, iâm just a scared idiot again
i keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality
others are running ahead but why am i still here?
breathe or dream
row the oars along with your heartbeat
if you are trapped in the otherâs thin judgements
then the sun will set on your life like a court
what am i doinâ with my life
this moment wonât ever come again
iâm asking myself again, am i happy right now?
the answer is already there, iâm happy",0

open my closed heart, drench my heart

your arms, your warmth, your heart
i want to see it all, i beg you

even the sky without a single cloud
everything feels cold and iâm even scared of the clear sky
if youâre not here, iâm just a corpse, so how can i breathe?
it hurts, iâm always cry cry cry
iâm going crazy, exhausted without you
i think of you without stopping
i hate it all, i hate every single day
it makes me cry, ring ding dong

"fall like those dry leaves
just falling without strength, my love
your heart just goes far away
i canât catch you
i canât catch you any more, any more
i canât hold onto you, yeah

those fallen leaves that look so insecure
seem like theyâre looking at us
if i touch your hand, even if itâs all at once
it seems like itâll all become crumbs
i only looked
with the autumn wind
your words and expressions that become cold at some point
i can see that our relationship is fading
an empty relationship like the autumn sky
an ambiguous difference compared to before
today of all days, the much quieter night
one leaf left clinging to a branch
itâs shattering, i see the end
dead leaves becoming dried
the silence inside your aloof heart
please donât leave me
please donât leave me, crumbling dead leaves

i want the you that meets my eyes
i want the you that wants me again
please donât leave me
please donât fall

never never fall
itâs fading

like all the dry leaves fall
like all the things i thought would last forever are leaving
you are my fifth season
even if i try to see you, i canât look
youâre still green to me
even if the heart doesnât move, it moves by itself
lingering feelings hung out piece by piece like laundry
only crimson memories fall
from above me
even if my branch doesnât shake
they constantly fall
right, my love must fall
in order to rise
even when youâre near, my two eyes
are far away, itâs happening
iâm being thrown away like this
inside my memories, i become young again

never never fall yeah
never never fall yeah

i want the you that meets my eyes
i want the you that wants me again
please donât leave me
please donât fall
never never fall
donât go far away

why canât i give up on you yet
i hold on to these faded memories
is this greed?
i try to look back on these lost seasons
i try to turn back

burn them brightly, whoosh
it was all beautiful, right, our path
but theyâve all faded
dry leaves come down like tears
the wind blows and everything grows apart all day
the rain is falling and youâre shattering
until the very last leaf, you you you

i want the you that meets my eyes
i want the you that wants me again
please donât leave me (oh)
please donât fall (yeah)
never never fall
donât go far away

baby you, girl i canât let you go

did i make any mistakes today
how did the audience seem
iâm happy with who iâve become
that i can make someone scream with joy
still excited from the performance

i stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long
while standing on this empty stage, i become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness
within my suffocating feelings
on top of my lifeâs line
without a reason, i forcibly act that i am fine
this isnât the first time, i better get used to it
i try to hide it, but i canât
when the heat of the show cools down
i leave the empty seats behind

trying to comfort myself
i tell myself the world canât be perfect
i start to let myself go
the thundering applause, i canât own it forever
i tell myself, so shameless
raise your voice higher
even if the attention isnât forever, iâll keep singing
as todayâs me, i want eternity
forever, i want to be young

forever we are young

under the flower petals raining down
i run, so lost in this maze

forever we are young

even when i fall and hurt myself
i endlessly run toward my dream

forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

forever ever ever ever
we are young

forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

forever ever ever ever
we are young

forever we are young

under the flower petals raining down
i run, so lost in this maze

forever we are young

even when i fall and hurt myself
i keep running toward my dream

forever we are young
under the flower petals raining down
i run, so lost in this maze
forever we are young
even when i fall and hurt myself
i keep running toward my dream",0

"ayo suga
i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other peopleâs things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
letâs not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
letâs not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

letâs move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letâs move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that weâre about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe thatâs why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
thereâs more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now letâs take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after youâre done, letâs get a bowl of black bean noodles, thatâs right

letâs move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letâs move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my momâs heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so iâm gonna move again
iâm gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

letâs move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letâs move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

letâs move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letâs move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

everyoneâs afraid of changes
staying, moving on, staying, moving on
we keep repeating the same things again and again
i guess thatâs life, iâm afraid
old or new, new or old, that isnât really important
whatâs important is, that we still breathe and live in the same place
so letâs move on",0
"yeah, the most lonely creature in the world
eh, do you want to know my story?
iâve never told this to anybody
yeah, come on

in the middle of the vast ocean
one whale speaks softly and lonelily
the fact that no matter how much they shout, it wonât reach
makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
of course i donât care whatâs the matter or what iâve now become
when loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
iâve become completely alone. it's a lock that fills sadness
someone says, âbastard, youâve become a celebrityâ
oh fuck that! so what?! nobody remains by my side and i'm fine on my own
these words that are easily said towards me quickly becomes a wall
even loneliness turns into something you can see

even if my breaths are blocked
because iâm confined in that wall
(i) head towards the surface of water above
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnât have a response
reaches tomorrow

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
an endless signal will reach someday
everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
even the blind whales will be able to see me
today i sing again

the world will never know
how sad i am
my hurt is water and oil that canât mix
so only above the surface of the water do i
breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends
a child in the lonely ocean
i want to make it known too
my value, everyday
i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never endâ¦ why is there no end and always hell?
as time goes by, itâs a neverland in a cold abyss!
but i always think, now
even if i sleep a shrimpâs sleep, my dreams are like that of a whaleâs
the upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday
like me, ye iâm swimminâ

i go towards my future
that blue beach and
believe in my hertz
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnât have a response
reaches tomorrow

mom said the sea is blue
she said to let out your voice as far as you can
but what to i do? itâs so dark here and there are only different whales speaking entirely different words!
i just canât hold it, ma! i want to say i love you
alone, i look back at this music sheet thatâs like a rotating song
this ocean is too deep
still, iâm lucky
(no one besides me knows of these tears.)
iâm a whalien

lonely lonely lonely whale
lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnât have a response
reaches tomorrow

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
an endless signal will reach someday
everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
even the blind whales will be able to see me
today i sing again",0

you, whoâs like a dream is a butterfly high to me

untrue untrue
you you you

will you stay by my side
will you promise me
if i let go of your hand, youâll fly away and break
iâm scared scared scared of that

will you stop time
if this moment passes
as though it hadnât happened
iâm scared scared scared iâll lose you

the small pieces guttered down darkly
from my heart, a barren noise
i donât know if this is reality or a dream
my kafka on the seaside
donât go to those woods over there
my heart is still shattering on you
(i just wanted to vaporize like this)
my love that is forever
itâs all free for you baby

will you stay by my side
will you promise me
if i let go of your hand, youâll fly away and break
iâm scared scared scared of that

will you stop time
if this moment passes
as though it hadnât happened
iâm scared scared scared iâll lose you

"the light of my future is dimming
because of my childish love, i lost my way on a path of dream
the venom of my ambition, i sharpened my knife every day
but because of my uncontrollable greed, my knife became dull
i know it all
this love is another name for the devil
donât hold their hand
i shouted but turned away from my conscience
i feel the sharp reality more every day
thereâs red blood from being torn apart by reality
i never thought that
the greed would become the trumpet heralding hell
breathe

my breath is getting shorter
i close my eyes every night from twisted reality
the music box of tragedy echoes
but in order to be free from this crime
itâs impossible to forget and give up
because those lips were too sweet
i threw my future away because i was drunk on dating
when i woke up, i was surrounded by land mines
surrounded by peopleâs stares that canât be touched
i shout for a miracle in this reality
(rewind)
it was crazy good
i was an idiot addicted to sweetness
yeah an idiot
i didnât want to let go of the devilâs hand

"the corner of my memory
a brown piano settled on one side
in the corner of my childhood house
a brown piano settled on one side

i remember that moment
way taller than my height
the brown piano that guided me
i looked up to you, i yearned for you
when i touched you with my small finger

i feel so nice mom i feel so nice
i played the piano wherever my hands took me
i didnât know your significance back then
back then i was content with just looking at you

i remember back during my elementary school days
when my height
became taller than yours
i neglected you when i once yearned for you so
on top of the white jade-like keyboard
dust is piling on
your image that has been neglected
even then i didnât know
your significance
no matter where i am
you always defended that spot
but i didnât know that would be the last
you say donât leave like this

donât worry even if i leave
youâll do well on your own
i remember when i first met you
before i knew it you grew up
though we are putting an end to our relationship
donât ever feel sorry to me
i will get to meet you again no matter what form
greet me happily then

i remember back then when i met you that
i had completely forgotten, when i was around 14
the awkwardness was only for a moment, i touched you again
even though i was gone for a long time
without repulsion
you accepted me
without you i am nothing
after the dawn, two of us
we welcomed the morning together
donât let go of my hand forever
i wonât let go of you again either

i remember back then
we burned up the last of my teenâs
yes the days when we couldnât see an inch in front of us
we laughed, we cried
those days with you, those moments are now in memories
i said, grasping my crushed shoulder
i really canât do any more
every time i wanted to give up
by my side you said
bastard you can really do it
yeah, yeah i remember back then
when i was fed up and lost
back then when i fell into a pit of despair
even when i pushed you away
even when i resented meeting you
you were firmly by my side
you didnât have to say anything
so donât ever let go of my hand
i wonât let you go ever again either
my birth and the end of my life
you will be there to watch over it all

"i know
every lifeâs a movie
we got different stars and stories
we got different nights and mornings
our scenarios ainât just boring
i find this movie very amusing
everyday, i want to shoot it well
i want to caress myself
i want to caress myself
but you know, sometimes
i really really hate myself
to be honest, quite often
i really hate myself
when i really hate myself, i go to dduksum
i just stand there with the familiar darkness
with the people that are smiling
and beer, which makes me smile
coming to me softly
fear, which holds my hand
itâs okay because everyone is in twos or threes
itâs good that i have a friend, too


the world is just another name for despair
my height is just another diameter for the earth
i am all of my joy and anxiety
it repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
hey you, whoâs looking over the han river
if we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
maybe we bumped into each other countless times
in the darkness
people look happier than the day
everyone else knows where theyâre supposed to be
but only i walk without purpose
but still, blending in with them is more comfortable
dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
hands me an entirely different world
i want to be free
i want to be free from freedom
because right now iâm happy but iâm unhappy
iâm looking at myself
at dduksum

had to work away from home

through the phone

with that promise alone

"take me to the sky

put your hands up to the sky, yeah
if you're feelin' the vibe, c'mon
if you're ready to fly
let's do it

i didnât have big worries
this small feather was going to become my wings
and with those wings, i was going to fly
i believed and i was full of faith
and laughter

i went down a path people told me not to
i did things people told me not to
i wanted things i should not want
i would be hurt, hurt again
you can call me stupid
then i just smirk
i donât want to be successful
doing something i donât want to do
i push myself

i believe in myself, my back hurts because
itâs to sprout my wings
i believe in you, i may be weak now
but in the end, it will be an incredible jump
fly, fly up in the sky
fly, fly get âem up high
this is the path you chose dude, donât doubt yourself
this is only the first flight uh

take me to the sky
if i can fly free
if i can run away forever

if my wings could fly
i would pierce through
the heavy air and fly
i fly, i fly, i fly

higher than higher than
higher than the sky
i fly, i fly, i fly
beat my red wings with all my might

"the light of my future is dimming
because of my childish love, i lost my way on a path of dream
the venom of my ambition, i sharpened my knife every day
but because of my uncontrollable greed, my knife became dull
i know it all
this love is another name for the devil
donât hold their hand
i shouted but turned away from my conscience
i feel the sharp reality more every day
thereâs red blood from being torn apart by reality
i never thought that
the greed would become the trumpet heralding hell
breathe

my breath is getting shorter
i close my eyes every night from twisted reality
the music box of tragedy echoes
but in order to be free from this crime
itâs impossible to forget and give up
because those lips were too sweet
i threw my future away because i was drunk on dating
when i woke up, i was surrounded by land mines
surrounded by peopleâs stares that canât be touched
i shout for a miracle in this reality

it was crazy good
i was an idiot addicted to sweetness
yeah an idiot

"the corner of my memory
a brown piano settled on one side
in the corner of my childhood house
a brown piano settled on one side

i remember that moment
way taller than my height
the brown piano that guided me
i looked up to you, i yearned for you
when i touched you with my small finger

i feel so nice mom i feel so nice
i played the piano wherever my hands took me
i didnât know your significance back then
back then i was content with just looking at you

i remember back during my elementary school days
when my height
became taller than yours
i neglected you when i once yearned for you so
on top of the white jade-like keyboard
dust is piling on
your image that has been neglected
even then i didnât know
your significance
no matter where i am
you always defended that spot
but i didnât know that would be the last
you say donât leave like this

donât worry even if i leave
youâll do well on your own
i remember when i first met you
before i knew it you grew up
though we are putting an end to our relationship
donât ever feel sorry to me
i will get to meet you again no matter what form
greet me happily then

i remember back then when i met you that
i had completely forgotten, when i was around 14
the awkwardness was only for a moment, i touched you again
even though i was gone for a long time
without repulsion
you accepted me
without you i am nothing
after the dawn, two of us
we welcomed the morning together
donât let go of my hand forever
i wonât let go of you again either

i remember back then
we burned up the last of my teenâs
yes the days when we couldnât see an inch in front of us
we laughed, we cried
those days with you, those moments are now in memories
i said, grasping my crushed shoulder
i really canât do any more
every time i wanted to give up
by my side you said
bastard you can really do it
yeah, yeah i remember back then
when i was fed up and lost
back then when i fell into a pit of despair
even when i pushed you away
even when i resented meeting you
you were firmly by my side
you didnât have to say anything
so donât ever let go of my hand
i wonât let you go ever again either
my birth and the end of my life
you will be there to watch over it all

"i know
every lifeâs a movie
we got different stars and stories
we got different nights and mornings
our scenarios ainât just boring
i find this movie very amusing
everyday, i want to shoot it well
i want to caress myself
i want to caress myself
but you know, sometimes
i really really hate myself
to be honest, quite often
i really hate myself
when i really hate myself, i go to dduksum
i just stand there with the familiar darkness
with the people that are smiling
and beer, which makes me smile
coming to me softly
fear, which holds my hand
itâs okay because everyone is in twos or threes
itâs good that i have a friend, too


the world is just another name for despair
my height is just another diameter for the earth
i am all of my joy and anxiety
it repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
hey you, whoâs looking over the han river
if we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
maybe we bumped into each other countless times
in the darkness
people look happier than the day
everyone else knows where theyâre supposed to be
but only i walk without purpose
but still, blending in with them is more comfortable
dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
hands me an entirely different world
i want to be free
i want to be free from freedom
because right now iâm happy but iâm unhappy
iâm looking at myself
at dduksum

"the world is a complex
we wus lookinâ for love
i was just one of those people
didnât even believe in true love
just said i wanted to be in love like a habit
but i found myself
the whole new myself
iâm confused too, which oneâs the real me?
did you figure out that iâm a book after i met you?
or did you turn my page?
damn
anyway, i wanna be the best man for you
of course, youâre the world to me
when you said you wanted to die with me
i promised to be the man you want, god i swore to myself
so many complex
but iâm lookinâ for love
i donât care if itâs a fake me, if you hold me
youâre my beginning and my end
so you finish me

all of my wonder
youâre the answer
i call you her, her
'cause youâre my tear, tear
all of my wonder
youâre the answer
i call you her, her
'cause youâre my tear, tear

maybe iâm your truth and your lie
maybe iâm your love and hate
maybe iâm your enemy and friend
your heaven and hell, your pride and embarrassment
i can never take off the mask
because the me behind this mask
is not the one you know
make up to wake up today too
and dress up to mask on
in order to become the me that you love
in order to become the one that you love
i quit the xx that i liked so much
just for you
i put on clothes i hate, excessive make up
because your laughter and happiness is the scale of my happiness
this is how i am, do i deserve your love?
i always make an effort to be the best for you
i hope you donât know this part of me

all of my wonder
youâre the answer
i call you her, her
'cause youâre my tear, tear
all of my wonder
youâre the answer
i call you her, her
'cause youâre my tear, tear

just like always, mask on
greeting me with cheers, her
iâm your star, i shine as if nothingâs wrong
but the moment i should shine the most, i take my mask off
lost star, iâm laying down my burdens, enjoying the darkness
thereâs no lights to shoot at me as if itâs killing me
just going wherever my heart goes
however my senses lead me, whatever doesnât hold me down
tick tock the dark is over
once again, to be your best
iâm holding onto myself
love makes a person go crazy
yeah, this is a crazy guyâs determination
substituting myself to be the most me
for you, who is my everything, iâm giving you the answer i came up with
but you love that
so through that, iâm making an effort
with your existence, i find new meaning and the night shines
now i know, even after the darkness
to me, you are the morning
you woke me up

all of my wonder
youâre the answer
i call you her, her
'cause youâre my tear, tear
all of my wonder
youâre the answer
i call you her, her

"(The Billboard Music Awards is playing)

Logan Paul and Lindsey Stirling: And the Billboard Music Award goes to... BTS!

(BTS enters the room)

Jimin: Ah PD-nim~
Jin: Hello
Suga: Hello, hello
(PD pauses the video)
Jin: Ah PD-nim what are you watching?
V: Hello (RM laughs)
Jin: Isnï¿½t that our Billboard video?
RM: You got caught
Jungkook: Hello
Jin: Youï¿½re not our fan right? (J-Hope laughs)
PD: No, Iï¿½m a-
Jin: Aye, it seems like it
V: Hyung, sit down
Jin: Yes (Laughs)
J-Hope: Youï¿½re embarrassed (RM laughs)... That can happen (Chattering)
PD: Ah, wait here for a while, I have a meeting
Jin: Bye fan-nim~

(PD leaves the room)

Jungkook: Ya, when was that from?
All the other members: Billboard
Jungkook: Were we just going up?
J-Hope: That was May right?
Jin: Yeah
RM: May, what day was it?
J-Hope: Now itï¿½sï¿½
Suga: That was May?
J-Hope: Well, itï¿½s almost September already
Suga: Thatï¿½s crazy
RM: Over 3 months ago
V: Woah, wow
Suga: There's only 4 months left now
J-Hope: Thatï¿½s right
Jin: Wow
RM: Itï¿½s like we feel it all of a sudden... 100 days left
J-Hope: Ahh really?
RM: Yeah
Jungkook: If you say that, it feels like itï¿½s a short time
RM: Yeah, sorry... (Laughter)
Suga: 100 days already passed? It felt really short
Jungkook: It feels like time barely passed by
J-Hope: Wow, time flies fast
Jin: The amount of emotion and goosebump-
Jungkook: Goosebumps
Jin: Goosebumps we felt at that moment, wow we became worldwide. That kind of feeling
Suga: (V laughs) Stop using ï¿½worldwideï¿½
Jin: Why? Honestly speaking, I made it up (Chattering) I said it first
RM: Yeah, thatï¿½s why I added that in the lyrics, ï¿½Sorry worldwideï¿½ (Laughter and chattering)
Suga: International pop... K...
V: Sunshine
Suga: Sunshine
BTS: Rainbow
Jin: That's over now
V: Shrimp
Jungkook: USB Hub
V: Hub...
Jin: Seriously, how far are you gonna go?

RM: But really, all of us grew a lot
Jin: Thatï¿½s right
RM: Be honest: when you guys first came, who didnï¿½t know what ï¿½Billboardï¿½ was?
Jimin: Me
J-Hope: Ahhhh~
Jungkook: Me
J-Hope: Me (RM laughs) Iï¿½m raising my hand slowly!
Jungkook: Honestly, I didnï¿½t know anything about music back then
Jimin: For me, I knew Billboard but I didn't even know what Grammy was
RM: That's understandable, but since Billboard has a chart I thought it was a good thing, so I was supporting it
Jimin: I thought there was a singer named ï¿½Grammyï¿½; I kept hearing Grammy mentioned with music. Thatï¿½s why I thought Grammy was a singer!
RM: Weï¿½re such noobs, arenï¿½t we?
Jimin: Aye, it was a long time ago
Suga: That was 7ï¿½8 years ago
RM: I said this in an interview before, when we were waiting... Hobi and I... we wereï¿½ what was it? We went to the (beeped out) store. We sat down and talked like a year before debut.
Jimin: Do you remember?
J-Hope: Of course I remember
RM: We both sat down and had a really long talk sitting there on the iron tape
Jin: What did you eat?
RM: I donï¿½t know. Back then, we ate food there that kinda looked like hotdogs
J-Hope: Yeah, thatï¿½s right, that's right
RM: Like food for 150 won.
Suga: Ah, right! There was that food (Chattering)
J-Hope: The store before it changed
Suga: There was that kind of food, about 150 won and 130 won (Chattering)
Jungkook: Wasnï¿½t it chilli or something?
RM: Something like that. Anyway, we were eating-
J-Hope: That time, I really didnï¿½t even know if it was going in my mouth or nose
RM: We talked about if we would even be able to debut for a long time.
Suga: We always talk about that
J-Hope: We were nervous
Jimin: Namjoon-hyung always said things like that
Jin: Thatï¿½s right
Jimin: We talked about it at Jamsil bridge and at the cafï¿½ with this hyung. He always called me up and always talked to me.
Jin: He called the members and talked to the members one by one often
RM: Cafï¿½ office. (Laughter)
Suga: Honestly it was scary. Every day was scary.
V: Honestly, when me and Namjoon-hyung took Japanese classes together
RM: Thatï¿½s right
V: I was very perceptive to someone I didnï¿½t even debut with yet (Laughter)
J-Hope: Oh, Jungkook and I always fell asleep in English class! (Laughter)
Jungkook: We both fell asleep in the same way (Laughter)
Jin: J-Hope and I only played in Chinese class (Laughter)
J-Hope: That was a really long time ago
RM: I didnï¿½t think weï¿½ll get to debut, even after the year we debuted
Suga: I... I even got injured at that time, I didnï¿½t think Iï¿½d debut
RM: To be honest, we are the only ones that received an award at the show as a K-Pop group
J-Hope: True
V: True

RM: Iï¿½m not saying we should boast, but to be honest it is a huge success. Thatï¿½s what I think. But because of that, I keep wondering - To what point, how far we need to go up. Like we go really far up. For example, the video in front of us, wonï¿½t it be replayed forever? Like in 10 years, we'll go on reality shows and theyï¿½ll play that video and ask how we felt over and over again. After experiencing that, it makes me nervous honestly. It makes me wonder how far we might fall down.
J-Hope: Ow... Yeah
Suga: Me too, me too. I relate so much because the hardest thing for me is that going up is going up. We worked hard to come up to where we are.
V: I donï¿½t like that
Suga: But compared to that, wonï¿½t falling down happen so quickly? I worry about that a lot.
RM: Hmm, thatï¿½s what Iï¿½m saying
Jin: Itï¿½s like when you meet someone for the first time and you have that kind of excitement - feelings of nervousness and worry of what this person is going to be like. Isnï¿½t it similar?
RM: First meeting kind of feeling?
Jin: Yeah, first meeting
J-Hope: What are you saying suddenly? (Laughs)
Jungkook: Yeah, hyung I think you reallyï¿½
Jin: Did I go too far?
J-Hope: We have to settle this today (Jimin laughs)
Jin: Ah, Iï¿½m nervous for today (Chattering)
J-Hope: We have to play a game today
Jungkook: I think I know what youï¿½re talking about
Jin: Yeah so if you understand, quickly make the mood or something yeah? (Laughter)
Jungkook: Sing a song!
Jin: Yeah

V: (Sings) ï¿½They tell me to comeï¿½ (Sings A Typical Traineeï¿½s Christmas) (Laughter and chattering)
Suga: I remember when Jungkook sang Seï¿½orita and his voice cracked!
Jimin: Ahh yeah Seï¿½orita... Back then, I couldnï¿½t even get lessons
J-Hope: Ahh thatï¿½s right
Jimin: I couldnï¿½t even get lessons, so I just watched
Jin: Jimin joined really late
Jimin: Somewhat, a little bit I... (Laughs)
V: Jimin thenï¿½
Jimin: Stop it, I know what youï¿½re going to say
V: When Jimin couldnï¿½t get lessons, he came to one of my lessons
Jimin: What?
V: When I was having lessons
Jimin: Vocal?
V: Yeah
Jungkook: Observer, observer
V: He was just observing that time and I thought I would show him a cool side of myself. All I did was ï¿½Doomba, doomba, doombaï¿½ (Laughter)
Jimin: Seriously, all he did was that for hours ï¿½Doom, doom, doomï¿½ (Jin laughs) He did that the whole time and ended
V: Ahh, I wanted to show him how cool I was
RM: That kind of feeling in those Chinese martial art films, they make you clean for 3 years
Jin: Ah thatï¿½s right, thatï¿½s right... You went to the kitchen and washed the dishes for 3 years
RM: Thatï¿½s right (Jimin laughs)
Jungkook: Thatï¿½s why Jimin-hyungsï¿½ first practice was ï¿½Why do you call me?ï¿½
Jin and Jimin: (Sings) ï¿½Why do you call me, why do you call me, tee de de deï¿½

RM: At that time, that was then and now is now. I think itï¿½s like our collective idea of an idol. About how we want to live, what we show. We keep throwing out social issue messages. Like even now, our album title is ï¿½Love Yourselfï¿½ too. We donï¿½t make meaningless songs, but doing this seems like weï¿½re acting too, as weï¿½re living our life.
Jimin: Yeah, so I think people might not knowï¿½
J-Hope: We want to show a good image to people (Chattering)
Jin: Weï¿½ve always
Jimin: They donï¿½t understand why we have to live like this - thereï¿½s no other way
Suga: Weï¿½ve always?
Jin: We have always shown ourselves as good people (J-Hope laughs)
Jimin: Yeah, I mean we want to show our good image too
Jin: Thatï¿½s right
Suga: This is, this is difficult. I mean it isnï¿½t fake for sure
Jimin: Right
Suga: If you think about it, weï¿½re just people that are presented after being wrapped up nicely
Jimin: But of course at the same time, it's not like we're trying to deceive anyone and lie... it's not that... we're just always trying to show them our good sides, so...",0
"oh, ah, yeah

i just started walking and ended up at the sea
iâm looking at the coast from here

countless people get cut from broadcast
but someoneâs empty spot is our dream
they say some of these kids canât make it cuz their agency is too small
i know, i know, i know too
times when the seven of us had to sleep in one room
with foolish hope that tomorrow will be different before we fell asleep
we saw the mirage in the desert but we couldnât grasp it
praying that weâll remain in this desert till the end
praying that this isnât truly our reality

in the end, we reached the mirage and it became our reality
the scary desert became the ocean with our blood, sweat and tears
but why is there this fear in between the happiness?
because we know too well that this place is really a desert

i donât wanna cry
i donât wanna rest
no, who cares if we rest a little?
no no no
i donât wanna lose
itâs always a desert

or just eating and sleeping
not doing anything at all yet still having a lot of money

i donât have a dream
to dream is sometimes scary
to just live like this
to survive like this is a small dream to me
to have a dream, to grasp a dream
to breathe, is sometimes too much to handle
saying this personâs living like this, that personâs living like that
the worldâs hurling at me

yeah
the world doesnât have the right to swear
what is the way to dream a dream
since they never taught us that
in the made up dream, sleep-talk of tears
i wake you up from the nightmare for you
now letâs try to smile everyday, in that paradise

itâs alright to stop
now we donât run without even knowing the destination
itâs alright to not have a dream
all the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

stop runninâ for nothinâ my friend
now stop that foolish race
stop runninâ for nothinâ my friend
all the breaths you breathe are already in paradise
stop runninâ for nothinâ my friend
you donât need something like a dream that everyone dreams
stop runninâ for nothinâ my friend
every language that makes you, is already in paradise",0

cause' iâll be in love maze

trapped in a maze of decisions
exhausted by all the different chaos
weâve wandered around, looking for the answer
lost in the maze, in the darkness

we ran and ran endlessly
but all the fake noise
canât tear us apart
itâs true baby

we must believe only in ourselves
canât let go of each otherâs hands
we need to be together forever

people say
that iâll end up a fool

rather like a fitness
iâve never been in a calculating love
i know itâll be cold like winter
but i still wanna try
if you push me, iâll fall, just raise me up again
even if i pull, you donât have to come

all around us is a maze, different paths
weâre walking in this abyss
thereâs a thin light over there
i hope weâre going toward paradise
know this, sometimes lies will try to tear us apart
hardships will try to deceive us but
just focus on me then
in the darkness, just the two of us is enough
in all these lies
if weâre together, even an endless maze is paradise

take my ay ay hand, donât let go
lie ay ay in this maze
my ay ay never lose me
in love maze

what can we do? we did the official thing
so we need to follow the rules
even in this wandering maze
even on this mysterious path
weâre taking care of each other
i always think, even if eternity is hard
i wanna try it, letâs be forever
our own mountain, our own climb
our own world, our own heart
travel toward the exit
held together, our hands become a map

"i know that youâre hesitating because even if you say the truth
in the end it will all return as scars

i said youâd win, didnât i?
i couldnât believe it (really)
could i win it?
this miracle that isnât a miracle
did we make it?
(no) i was here
you were the one that made your way to me
i do believe your galaxy
i want to listen to your melody
your stars in the milky way
donât forget that i found you anyways
at the end of my despair
youâre the last reason
for me who was standing at the edge of the cliff
live

on days i hate being myself, days i want to disappear forever
let's make a door in your heart
open the door and this place will await
it's okay to believe, the magic shop will comfort you

while drinking a glass of hot tea
and looking up at the milky way
youâll be alright, oh, this here is the magic shop

so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
show you show you

like a rose when blooming
like cherry blossoms when being scattered in the wind
like morning glory when fading
like that beautiful moment
i always want to be the best
so i was impatient and always restless
comparing myself with others became my daily life
my greed that was my weapon suffocated me and also became a leash
but looking back on it now, truthfully
i feel like itâs not true that i wanted to be the best
i wanted to become your comfort and move your heart
i want to take away your sadness, and pain

on days where i hate myself for being me, on days where i want to disappear forever
let's make a door. it's in your heart
open the door and this place will await

would you believe me if i said that i was scared of everything too?
all the sincerity, the remaining times
all your answers are in this place you found
in your milky way, inside your heart

you gave me the best of me
so you'll give you the best of you
you found me. you knew me
you gave me the best of me
so you'll give you the best of you
you'll find it, the galaxy inside you

"goodbyes are, for me, a tear
without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
the words that i could not bring myself to say flow down
and lingering regret crawls over my face
to me, you were once my dear
but now you're merely a bitter beer
my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie
the price that i had to pay came to me
if someone said they would turn back the time for me
would i have been able to be a bit more honest?
the bare face that only i know
the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before
with that smile with which you used look at me
stop saying things like forever, forever
after all, the end originally exists
if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that
words that are too correct or too much consolation.. i don't wanna listen to that
i was just so scared
because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all
although it was late, that you were true
that only you loved me
more

you're my tear
you're my, youâre my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
what more can i say?
you're my tear

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my fear
you're my, you're my fear
what more can i say?
you're my...

goodbyes are t.e.a.r
because things like tears are a luxury
there's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
so just begin now
woo take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
that's right, thatâs right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating
woo yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
so not even the ashes remain

this is the real you and this is the real me
now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
i've woken up from the sweet dream and i close my eyes
this is the real you and this is the real me

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my fear
you're my, you're my fear
what more can i say?
you're my...

what should i say?
we know
the answer is fixed
but replying is always hard

why are you spilling it?
why are you tearing it up?
it's useless, to me
goodbye to me is only those moments (flashback)
the moment you say words from your mouth
the moment our focus becomes irregular
at the moment where everything is dangerous
our end that two letters handed to us
that i won't cry, that i won't tear it up
i can't say those kinds of words. in the future i, too
breakup, incurable disease
you're my beginning and my end, that is all
my meeting and my farewell
you were everything, step forward fear
it will be repeated, caused by you

she seemed flustered as she stared at the diary she once believed she lost. within every turned page were the movies she liked, the places she wanted to go, the flowers she preferred, and the future she hoped for. i had done this for her. âiâm sorry,â never came easy for me. the diary acted as a starting and stopping spot for us.
i wanted to make her happy. i wanted to make her laugh. i wanted to be a good person. i thought that following the words from the diary would help me do so. but thatâs not how it worked. the more i tried to be someone else the more frightened i became. wouldnât my real self be discovered? wouldnât she be disappointed and leave me? desperately, i hid and turned away from myself. but just like how a person canât end a sentence without it being complete, the me who i lost couldnât improve and instead wandered around the same places.
i know now that the me that is incapable and makes mistakes and fails is still a part of myself. no matter how terrible things become, only by being true to myself can i continue to move forward. i stood up and she didnât stop me.
i left onto the street and took my hat off. as i swept my hair back, all the hours i spent trying to mold myself into someone else slipped through my fingers. i lifted my head and looked at my reflection in the window. staring back at me were pale lips, a frail face, thin shoulders. i looked wretched. i laughed. my reflection laughed too.

a lone flowerpot rested on the storage roomâs window. i didnât know where it came from. which of my dongsaeng brought it? i took out my phone. the classroom was always dark with shadows since there wasnât any electricity, but i could still distinguish green leaves from the pale light coming from the windows. the photo i took on my phone didnât come out good, and it wasnât because i simply took it with a phone. i pondered this often - how a photo never captures what eyes can.
i noticed an âhâ written below the flowerpot when i approached. when i lifted it up i read âhoseokâs flowerpot.â i laughed. hoseok was the only dongsaeng whoâd bring a flowerpot here. i placed it back on the windowsill so only the âhâ is visible again. i then looked around. i didnât notice this before, but the windowsill was covered with scattered writing. the walls and ceiling were covered in it too. âpass or die,â the names of unrequited love, dates, and countless names that had become worn and illegible.
this classroom hadnât always been a storage room. students used to filter it every day. itâd be filled when school began and emptied during vacations. were there students like us? would they receive punishments for being late and missing class? were there mercilessly violent teachers and never ending exams and coursework? were there teachers whoâd tell principals about their students and their friends?
i wondered whether my fatherâs name lied among the words. the school was my fatherâs alma mater. he was someone who believed attending the same schools maintained a familyâs dignity. i read over the names and found my fatherâs. it was in the middle of the left wall surrounded by other names. a quote was written underneath it, âeverything started here.â

it was april 11th again when my eyes opened. sunlight shined through the open curtain. i was overwhelmed with vertigo when i stood up. i had to close my eyes. when i did this, my surroundings morphed into a red afterimage, and i saw taehyung. he was standing alone on top of the observation platform at the sea. that happened on may 22nd. it was the past and the future. it was something thatâd happened already and something that still had the chance to happen again. it was then that i thought everything had finally been fixed.
i watched taehyung climb to the top of the platform as the sun began to set. the sky was still blue, but it was slowly blooming into red. i saw taehyung climbing when i lifted my head. he reached the top after a few moments and looked down at us. then he jumped. he leapt as if he had the wings of a bird, and for a few seconds it seemed as if he froze in the air. something overcame me the way a mirror breaks, the way cold air blows in from an open window.
when my eyes opened again it was today, april 11th.

what was the reason that that particular melody became stuck in my head only after i lost the person iâd practice it with? i glanced at the piano across the room as i reclined on the couch. when i was expelled i threw away the piano key that belonged to my mother - the only thing i'd salvaged from the ruins of my burned house. the piano key half burned itself. i threw it out of my apartmentâs window. i thought doing so would end it. i repeated to myself, like i had all those years ago, that iâd never lay my hands on a piano again.
early the next day, i hurried down the stairs unable to wait for the elevator. i thought iâd fallen asleep abruptly, but the sun had risen already. the things i did the night before suddenly flooded my thoughts. the flowerbed outside the window was vacant. when i asked the security guard he told me that the garbage truck had already came, and thatâs how i lost my motherâs piano key.
i continued to give up on music after that countless times. i wonât do it. i wonât come back. music is nothing. but even when i ran away, i knew. i knew that iâd return to music. the same why iâd stumbled down that staircase, music was the kind of thing iâd never be able to let go of. internally, i was just as free as i was a person who was suffering. i was confused, but i was also lucid. fear and confidence, hope and despair - i lived between those contrasting emotions.
suddenly, i was overcome with the desire to play the piano. i wanted to recognize the me who had pretended to be strong despite the reality that i was a fearful coward. i wanted to pour the curses and make fractures and inflict wounds and hit and destroy and hold and cry. but i didnât want to run away. i wanted to finish the melody from the piano that frequented my mind every day. for once, it seemed like i could.

i kept walking with the acknowledgement that jungkook was following me. containers continued to appear when i reached the train tracks. it was the fourth container from the back. hoseok mentioned having plans to meet namjoon and taehyung. he told me to join them. i said i would, but i didnât really plan to attend. i hated being attached to other people, and hoseok knew that. he probably didnât expect iâd stay true to my word.
when i pulled the door open, hoseok stared at me shocked. when he saw jungkook behind me an exaggerated expression of mixed emotion drew across his face. i pushed past both of them and strolled to the container. âhow long has it been?â i could hear hoseok trying to pull jungkook, who was shy, in.
namjoon and taehyung entered. a side of taehyungâs shirt was ripped. when questioned about it, namjoon pretended to hit taehyung with his knuckles. âthis kidâs late because he got caught by some cops doing graffiti and i had to go pick him up.â taehyung made a melodramatic apologetic face and explained that his shirt had been ripped in the process of running away.
i sat in the corner and watched them. namjoon gave taehyung a new shirt to change into, and hoseok pulled out hamburgers and beverages. in the midst of everything, jungkook stood awkwardly. he stood as if he hadnât any idea what to do.  in retrospect, itâs exactly how he acted in high school. hoseok would noisily move around while jungkook hovered around him unsure of what to do.
how long had it been since we met like this? i couldnât remember. what happened to seokjin hyung and jimin? an uncharacteristic thought crossed my mind. this was the place iâd visited for the first time while my heart was lost somewhere else.

the sheet was immediately engulfed in flames. the pile of objects lost their identities among the intense heat. i couldn't smell the rotting mold nor feel the overbearing humidity nor see the dark light. the only thing left was pain - the pain of the flames, the pain of my fingers blistering. it was only among the fire that my fatherâs emotionless expression and the sound of music relented.
i was very different from my father. he didnât understand me and i didnât understand him. could i have changed his mind if i tried? probably not. all i could do for him was run and hide and defy. it occasionally occurred to me that it wasnât my father that i was escaping. but if it wasnât him, what was it? fear settled in for a moment. what was i running from? what ends did i have to go to to be free? it all felt impossible.
it felt like i could hear someone calling, but i didnât look away from the dancing flames. i couldnât breathe. i donât know if it was the smoke or the pain. i didnât have the power to move anymore. despite this, i knew it was jungkookâs voice that was calling. he mustâve been upset and angry. maybe heâd feel bad for me. i just wanted to disappear. i wanted the smoke and heat, just everything, to end. jungkook shouted something again, but i couldnât hear it. my gaze fell. when i looked up again i saw the sight of a dirty room in a dirtier world. during what i thought would be my last moments, i saw red flames, endless smoke, and jungkookâs panicked face.

i lifted my head from scanning the magazine advertisements. a different face had been occupying the window seat of the library across from me for the past few days. the heavy book, large bag, and paper cup were the same, but it wasnât her. i looked back down at the magazine. i was reading the same page over and over again for an hour. my eyes werenât processing the words at all. why was i still here? i couldnât fabricate an answer. among people who were absorbed in their own worlds, i was carelessly reading the same page of a magazine. i felt impatient, as if something was supposed to start, but i knew nothing would happen.
i brought the magazine back and strolled between bookshelves. they were taller than i was, filled to the brim with books. an open window breeze carried the libraryâs scent in the air. i reminisced my highschool years. the books i read in the company of my friends in that storage room had the same scent. had the present me grown from the old me at all? i couldnât bring myself to be positive. it couldâve been because everything seemed to be frozen back then. i moved to a different bookshelf and picked an old book i studied from high school. i had to start over. i had to give everything up one at a time.

i knew something was going on with taehyung for a long time. although he pretended that nothing was wrong, his momentary anxieties gave it away. the fact that he didnât know how to handle it made it all the more obvious to me. he was in and out of the police station. he had wounds all over his body. he had nightmares.
i never pressed on the issue because i was waiting for taehyung to bring it up himself. the reason i never confronted him was also because i doubted my own to right to hear about it. i wanted to be a hyung, an adult. but in the end it all comes to the simple fact that i couldnât help my friends when they were struggling. they praised me for being all grown up, but i wasnât really an adult. faced with problems, i could only hesitate and ignore the reality before me.
yoongi hyung died - taehyung had that nightmare again today. i had to shake him from his sleep. he sat in silence for a long time staring into space. he didnât wipe his tears and he mumbled incoherent things. he mumbled about yoongi dying and jungkook getting in an accident and me being caught up in a fight. he said that he dreamed of those types of things everyday - that the traumas were so clear that they seemed real. âhyung, donât go anywhere.â

i finished pumping gas. i begun returning to the shop. something brushed against my face and fell. stepping back, a crumbled bill settled at my feet. out of reflex, i reached down. the random people in the car laughed, and i stopped reaching down. seokjin hyung watched me from a distance. i couldnât raise my head. what are you supposed to do when you make eye contact with people who drive expensive cars and ridicule others? you confront them. if you believe theyâre doing something unjust then you have to confront them. itâs not a matter of pride or bravery or equality. itâs something that you just have to do.
but i was a part-time worker at a gas station. if a customer threw trash i had to clean it up. if they cussed me out i had to listen. if they threw a bill at my feet i had to pick it up. my body shook with humiliation. i dug my fingernails into my palm.
at that moment, someoneâs hand reached down and picked up the bill. the car filled with people left as if the fun was over. i couldnât look up even after they were gone. i didnât have the courage to look seokjin hyung in the eyes. it wasn't like he didnât know about my cowardliness, my poverty, my situation, but i still didnât want him to witness it. hyung stood at the end of my gaze. he didnât move. he didnât approach. he didnât speak.

jimin and she stood in the middle of the practice studio. the starting pose seemed endless. when the music flowed from the speaker, they begun the choreography i practiced with her not that long ago. i watched from my place on the floor.
when i first discovered that my ankle momentary prevented me from dancing, itâd been hard to swallow. it was stifling to simply watch otherâs dance. but overtime, as i taught and helped jimin improve, i realized that not being able to dance wasnât that big of a deal. i could continue to be happy other ways.
i couldnât let even the smallest of mistake go overlooked when i helped jimin. when he made a movement smaller or more subdued, iâd stop him and examine each movement individually. but when i returned to my place on the floor, almost like an audience for jimin, i realized that jiminâs dancing was bigger that just the step to step movements. i viewed what i originally recognized as mistakes differently. the trivial mistakes and imperfections contributed  to something greater, something unique. it was different than my own dancing, but jimin had his own timing and his own expression. his dancing was bight and heartwarming on its own.
when the music ended, jiminâs dance did too. his face glowed with excitement and happiness. she stood next to him. sheâd be going overseas soon. we locked eyes. she didnât look like my mother at all because i couldnât remember my motherâs face. so why did i see my mother in her? my heart began to ache, and the pain in my ankle intensified.

i liked being around people. when i was still at the orphanage i worked at a fast food chain and was exposed to a lot of people. iâd always laugh and be cheerful. i liked that job. with my experience of being exposed to more bad than good, it was evident that i had few reasons to laugh and be cheerful. perhaps thatâs why i enjoyed the job so much. it gave me the opportunity to laugh and smile and be happy. what does it matter if it was usually forced? overtime i could trick myself into believing that it was all real. my mood became better when i let myself laugh and by treating people kindly i became a kinder person. there were hard days, like always, and sometimes taking a step forward would be too overwhelming. but even so, it was easier back then to withstand the hard days because i had friends. things arenât the same now.
sometimes i remembered my friends when i looked at the store of customers. seokjin hyung, who transferred in, namjoon, who disappeared one day, yoongi, who wouldnât answer calls anymore, taehyung, whose whereabouts we werenât sure of, and jimin, who never returned after he went to the emergency room. iâd seen jungkook in his school uniform through the window a few times, but he never frequented the store anymore. perhaps those times had passed.
i heard the sound of a customer entering. with a cheerful smile, i greeted them.

i opened the emergency exit door and rushed down the staircase. my heart felt like it was going to explode. i swore i glimpsed the clear face of my mother in the hospital hallway. when i looked back, people from the opened elevator doors distorted my vision. i pushed through the people and followed where iâd seen my mother leaving through the emergency exit. without rest and with an anxious heart, i ran down the stairs two at a time.
âmom!â my mother ceased her walking. she turned around. i ran down another flight. her face became visible. it was then that i lost my balance and my center of gravity fell forward. i closed my eyes, but a personâs hand reached out and held onto my arm. when i looked back at my savior, jimin stared at me with a shocked expression. before i could thank him, i turned my head.
there was a woman with a surprised face. a young boy stood next to her with wide, unblinking eyes. the woman wasnât my mother. i remained at the top of the staircase staring at her blankly.
i didnât remember how i got out of that situation. i didnât ask how jimin had managed to catch my fall either. my mind couldnât focus on such trivial details. the woman wasnât my mother, and somewhere deep down i knew that from the start. itâs been more than 10 years since she left me alone in that theme park. sheâd be older now. if i met her, i wouldnât recognize her by now. i could barely even remember how she looked all those years ago.
when i glanced behind me, jimin was following me quietly. back in highschool, jimin told me that he had stayed in the hospital after being in the emergency room. i thought about how he looked at me, unsure of how to respond to the inquiry of whether he wanted to leave the hospital. was jimin trapped the same way i was, incapable of both holding on and letting go of old memories? i took a step toward him.
âjimin-ah. letâs get out of here.â

i was stuck in the practice studio again. it was late and the train stopped running. to be honest, i had waited for it to stop so i could practice alone and obsess over my imperfections. i was restless. i was scared. but it was something i wanted to do, and so i stayed in that room overnight.
overtime, my fear in my heart began to evaporate. only the fun air of dancing persisted. for the longest time, i believed that the weak, small, powerfless me i imagined was real. when i danced i could only think of my own weight or the length of my body or my speed or my strength. however, the me who danced wasnât small nor weak. my stuttering movements became more fluid and i improved. i grew the way fingernails do. slowly. i realized that i was actually an expressive person. i felt this way when i danced, like i was saying everything i couldnât. when i started to dance i, for the first time, started to like myself.

hoseok hyung lived in a rooftop apartment at the end of a narrow alley. it was very high. when i visited the one room apartment heâd brag about how it was the highest room in the city. he bragged that he could see everything, every place, from his rooftop room. from the window we could see the trains and the train tracks and the containers. namjoon hyung lived in one of those. if i moved my gaze down a little i could see the school we all used to attend.
after locating the school, i drew my gaze to the opposite side of the city. a line of apartments rested at the bottom of the mountain. there was my - no - my parentâs house. they were looking for me. when i ran away from the hospital without a word they were contacted. i didnât have the confidence to face them. i couldnât go home yet. that didnât mean i wanted to return to the hospital, but i had nowhere to go and no money. hyung had told me to follow him, and he lead me here - hyungâs house.
i looked back to the apartment buildings. i had to return eventually. i had to tell my parents i wasnât going back to the hospital. i inhaled sharply and then slowly exhaled. it felt like the mere thought could trigger another seizure. i didnât trust myself anywhere other than at the hospital. i could be rushed there again. i was so afraid. i couldnât stand it.

hoseok hyung stood next to me when i opened my eyes. an all too familiar ceiling looked down at me with a familiar darkness. i tried to sit up, but he put his finger up to his lips. everyone was sleeping. the room was quiet. hyung offered me a new shirt, and jerked his head toward the exit of the hospital.
âwe all came together.â  he said that namjoon hyung was keeping guard while yoongi hyung was buying time talking with the nurses. jungkook and taehyung would meet us at the elevator. hyung reached out a hand when he saw my confused expression. i was still in a daze.
iâd dreamed of the day iâd leave the hospital sometimes. i wanted to leave and see my friends so i could spend time with them and laugh and talk the way we did before, but now i didnât know. was it actually a good idea to leave? my parents hid me here and buried my existence. people whispered that i had a mental illness. i didnât know if hoseok hyung viewed me the same way. maybe he thought i was strange. maybe i made him uncomfortable.
âcome on. weâre running out of time.â the clockâs second hand sound seemed unconventionally fast because of hyungâs words. the sound of footsteps, like an auditory hallucination, came closer to the hospital room. hyung and i looked toward the door and then at each other. he never let his hand leave me.

when i turned around, i discovered small letters written below the âxâ that spelled out short sentences. one said âit isnât my fault.â it was her. i hadnât seen her myself and i didnât know her handwriting, but i knew. it seemed like a last goodbye, saying that it wasnât my fault she left, saying that this didnât happen because i was a bad person, saying that i shouldnât blame or torment myself, saying that i should be brave.
when i came to my senses i was back at my house. i could hear noonaâs scream from behind the door. i flung it open and a familiar scene was laid out. i moved to block noona from my father and i grabbed him. i looked him in the eyes and at first he seemed surprised. but then he swung. it knocked me out for a second. this wasnât the first time that sort of thing happened. noonaâs crying grew louder. my chin ached and the smell of rust stained my mouth. but i didnât stop. i grabbed my father by his waist and he angrily yelled. he beat my shoulders and back relentlessly. i only held on tighter.
it wasnât that i didnât feel the pain. it wasnât that i wasnât scared. it was the understanding that if i let go, this same daily cycle of pain and suffering would repeat. i wanted things to change.
no. iâm not like my father. iâm going to protect our family. something he couldnât do.

âhyung, is that all? you arenât hiding anything else from us?â our surroundings became quiet simultaneously. everyoneâs eyes were on me. i looked at seokjin hyung. he looked back at me. his eyes were full of exhaustion and pity. somebody grabbed my arm and stopped me before i could press the issue again. i didnât have to look to know it was namjoon hyung.
âwhat does it have to do with you? you arenât my real brother.â i could feel namjoonâs stare. i shook off his hand without lifting my head. i knew that i was angry at him for no reason. i repeated the words i heard hyung use on the phone - that i was angry, that i was upset. his words werenât incorrect. i was a year younger than him. i wasnât his brother. it was true that i should take care of myself, but i was still upset. i was angrier than i could put into words. i hoped heâd understand.
âtaehyung-ah iâm sorry. letâs stop talking about this.â it was seokjin hyung who said this. it was seokjin hyung who called my name. it was seokjin hyung who apologized. namjoon hyung didnât do anything. âwhat do you mean stop? since itâs come up, why donât we talk about everything. you have something else youâre hiding.â
âletâs talk outside.â namjoon hyung replied holding onto my arm again. he dragged me out before i could shake him off. âlet me go. what right do you have to stop me? what do you know, hyung? you donât know anything. you just think heâs this great guy, right?â he let go of my arm after that. i stumbled at the release. no, it wasnât just him letting me go that made me stumble. when he released my arm, it felt as if everything that had sustained me for so long crumbled. perhaps i hoped heâd never let go, that heâd get angry and drag me out the way he did. perhaps i hoped heâd scold me like a real brother, like someone close and precious.
but hyung let go of my arm, and i could only laugh. âwhatâs so special about being together? what are we to each other? weâre all alone in the end.â that was the moment seokjin hyung hit me.

the gas station worker spat on the ground when he left, and i sprawled my body on the ground again. iâd been caught spraying graffiti on the wall of the gas station, and the owner hit me while asking what i thought i was doing drawing on someoneâs wall. i rolled on the ground. getting beaten was something i was used to.
i started graffiti a long time ago when i found a discarded spray can someone left behind. i think it was yellow. i sprayed it around and stared at the paint. it was a bright yellow against the grey wall. for a while, i mindlessly painted like that, and i only stopped when i ran out of paint. i threw it away and stepped back to examine my work. i felt out of breath at the sight.
i didnât know what it meant. i didnât know what the designs and colors stood for or what iâd done or why i did it. but i did it, and so i concluded that it was an expression of my feelings stained on the wall. iâd spewed my heart out, and at first i thought the drawing was ugly. for a moment, i wanted to erase it from the wall. however, instead of erasing it i caked on other colors and other shapes and other designs. i sat against it when i was done. it didnât matter whether i liked it or not. it didnât matter whether it was beautiful or not. it was me.
i coughed when i rose to my feet. when i hunched over and spat out blood, i saw someoneâs hand reach down to pick up the spray can. it was namjoon hyung. i chuckled. i thought he was some sort of ghost. he reached out his hand, and i simply looked back up at him. hyung took my hand and helped me stand up properly. his hand was warm.

when i looked back, the hospital was a faraway place. i couldnât see the bench i left those wildflowers nor the window i looked out with her anymore. she was a space that let me breathe in the stuffy atmosphere of the hospital. weâd sit on that bench and talk about everything until the sun would set. i talked about playing in the hideout and vacations i took to the beach and walking to the train station. she told me about the corners of the hospital and which window you could watch the river from and the which staircase secretly led to the roof. there wasnât anything she didnât know about that hospital.
her room was empty because she was discharged. or did she move to a different hospital? i asked the nurses, but they said it was confidential. a corner of my soul felt empty. when i turned around and started walking i could see the school. it seemed that everything i ever told her about myself had something to do with the hyungs. every story i told incorporated them in some way. for the lonelier part of me, the hyungs had become my friends, family, and teachers. my story was intertwined with theirs, and i only existed within them.
at some point it occured to me there may come a time after my time spent with them. one day i may go looking only to discover that theyâd be gone. or maybe something else could happen. i didnât know.
i thought about that night, when the moon ascended in the sky, the world turned upside down, the headlamps inverted on themselves, the car passed me and then disappeared, the sound of the engine. it was familiar for some reason. i didnât want to jump to conclusions, but i still kept thinking about that moment.

âhyungs. what do you dream about?â the hyungs looked back at me in response to my question. âi have to write a paper about future hopes.â i elaborated. seokjin hyung opened his mouth and said, âi donât think i have a dream. if i have something i hope for, itâs just to the extent ofâ¦ wanting to become a good person?â he cut himself off, seeming embarrassed. then yoongi hyung, who was at the piano, spoke in an airy voice. âitâs okay to not have a dream. i donât have one. iâm just going to become whatever.â everyone burst out at his words. they fit him well.
âiâm going to become a superhero and save the world from bad guys.â taehyung said this while standing on his chair to pose. he reached his arms toward the sky. hoseok hyung scolded him telling him to get down before he got hurt. hoseok hyung then added, âi want to find my mom and live happily. being happy is my dream.â hyung smiled as he spoke. âdoes that mean youâre unhappy now?â jimin asked. hoseok hyung replied, âwhen i was in preschool i wanted to be president, but i didnât have anything i wanted to be after that.â
only namjoon hyung was left after that. after feeling everyoneâs eyes on him, he shrugged. âi want to say something nice, but i donât really have a dream either. i just wish my part-time job paid more.â i nodded and stared down at the paper in front of me. the paper was divided into spaces for students and spaces for parents. what did i want to become? i couldnât think of anything to write.

i walked down the rooftop railing of an abandoned building. when i lifted my leg, my foot was shadowed by the darkness bubbling below. the night of the city was spread out underneath my feet. neon signs, honking horns, and dust was scattered around in the dark. for a moment i felt dizzy from vertigo. i stretched my arms out to balance myself. then i thought about it. it would only take one wrong step. itâd only take one step to end everything. i leaned toward the darkness and it spread from my foot and up my leg. my breathing stopped when i leaned further. my mind was void of any thoughts. nothing. no one. i didnât want to leave anything behind, but i couldnât remember anything. this was the end.
it was then that my phone began to ring. clarity washed over me as if iâd awoken from a dream. my subdued senses returned, and i pulled out my phone. it was yoongi hyung.",0

too many words circle around me

i just feel it
like the moon rises after the sun rises
like how fingernails grow
like trees that shed their bark once a year
that you are the one who will give meaning to my memories
who will make a 'person' into 'love'
before i knew you
my heart was filled with straight lines only
i'm just a human, human, human
you erode all my corners
and make me into love, love, love
we're humans, humans, humans
in that myriad of straight lines
my love, love, love

you make live to a love
live to a love
because of you
i know why a person should live by love
it's a long way from i to u
fuck, jklmnopqrst
i crossed all the letters and i reached you
look, mine and yours also sound the same
though that doesn't make me you
i want to be part of your bookcase
i'd like to be involved in your novel
as a lover
i'm just a human, human, human
you erode all my edges
and make me into love, love, love

i awake from sleep
a sound full of unfamiliarity
try to cover my ears but canât go to sleep

the pain in my throat gets worse
try to cover it
i donât have a voice

itâs ringing again, that sound
a crack again on this frozen lake
i dumped myself into the lake
i buried my voice for you
over the winter lake i was thrown

a thick ice has formed
in the dream i shortly went into
my agonizing phantom pain is still the same
have i lost myself

or have i gained you
i suddenly run to the lake
thereâs my face in it
please donât say anything

reach my hand out to cover the mouth
but in the end, spring will come someday
the ice will melt and flow away
tell me if my voice isnât real

if i shouldnât have thrown myself away
tell me if even this pain isnât real

this garden bloomed
full of thorns
i bind myself in this sand castle

what is your name
do you have a place to go
oh could you tell me?
i saw you hiding in this garden

and i know
all of your warmth is real
the blue flower your hand was picking
i want to hold it but

itâs my fate
donât smile to me
lie to me
because i canât get closer to you

show you me
give you me

but i still want you

bloomed in a garden of loneliness
a flower that resembles you
i wanted to give it to you
after i take off this foolish mask

but i know
i can't do that forever
i have to hide
because i'm a monster

i am afraid
i am shattered
iâm so afraid
that you will leave me again in the end
once again i put on a mask and go to see you

the only thing i can do
in the garden
in this world
is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you
and to breathe as the me that you know
but i still want you
i still want you

maybe back then
a little
just this much
if i had the courage to stand before you
would everything be different now

i'm crying

"it was a good start
the ups and downs, themselves
before i knew it, we grew tired
with meaningless emotional drains
repeated seesaw game
now, i'm so sick of this
repeated seesaw game
we're getting sick and tired of each other
were the petty arguments the start?
the moment i became heavier than you
because there have never been parallels in the first place
maybe it was my greed trying to match myself with you
if it was love, and if this is what love means
is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
we're tired of each other, yet seem to be holding the same cards
well, then
alright, a repeating seesaw game
it's about time we put an end to it
all right, this boring seesaw game
somebody has to get off of it
there's no turning back
let's not measure who will get off first
letâs not drag things out
let's follow our hearts
let's put an end to this
this repeated seesaw game
let's end this now
people can be so crafty
we know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
but because we don't want to be the villains
in the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
we became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
although this wasn't the kind of parallel that i wanted
at first, we showed off who was heavier
we bragged and smiled at each other
now we're trying measure who's heavier
a competition between us
that became a flame, igniting quarrels
itâll only end if someone gets off right here
acting like weâre comforting each other
with words mixed with thorns
canât keep doing this, we need to make a decision
if we didnât have feelings for each other
if we didnât think of each other
would we have dragged it out like this?
now if you donât have any more feelings
this seesaw is dangerous
stop thinking about me
alright, a repeating seesaw game
it's about time we put an end to it
all right, this boring seesaw game
somebody has to get off of it
there's no turning back
(hol' up hol' up) i walk on this seesaw without you
(hol' up hol' up) just like the beginning when you weren't here

"goodbyes are, for me, a tear
without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
the words that i could not bring myself to say flow down
and lingering regret crawls over my face
to me, you were once my dear
but now you're merely a bitter beer
my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie
the price that i had to pay came to me
if someone said they would turn back the time for me
would i have been able to be a bit more honest?
the bare face that only i know
the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before
with that smile with which you used look at me
stop saying things like forever, forever
after all, the end originally exists
if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that
words that are too correct or too much consolation.. i don't wanna listen to that
i was just so scared
because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all
although it was late, that you were true
that only you loved me
more

you're my tear
you're my, youâre my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
what more can i say?
you're my tear

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my fear
you're my, you're my fear
what more can i say?
you're my...

goodbyes are t.e.a.r
because things like tears are a luxury
there's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
so just begin now
woo take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
that's right, thatâs right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating
woo yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
so not even the ashes remain

this is the real you and this is the real me
now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
i've woken up from the sweet dream and i close my eyes
this is the real you and this is the real me

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead

what more can i say?
you're my...

what should i say?
we know
the answer is fixed
but replying is always hard

why are you spilling it?
why are you tearing it up?
it's useless, to me
goodbye to me is only those moments (flashback)
the moment you say words from your mouth
the moment our focus becomes irregular
at the moment where everything is dangerous
our end that two letters handed to us
that i won't cry, that i won't tear it up
i can't say those kinds of words. in the future i, too
breakup, incurable disease
you're my beginning and my end, that is all
my meeting and my farewell
you were everything, step forward fear
it will be repeated, caused by you

the fear-ridden eyes, asking the question

loving myself might be harder
than loving someone else

the standards i made are more strict for myself
the thick tree rings in your life

our lives are long, trust yourself when in a maze
when winter passes, spring always comes

the target of  thousands of bright arrows is me alone

i should love myself (oh)
iâll answer with my breath, my path

the me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow
(iâm learning how to love myself)
with no exceptions, itâs all me

maybe thereâs no answer
maybe this isnât the answer either

doesnât require anyone elseâs permission
iâm looking for myself again

me, who used to be sad
me, who used to be hurt

itâs an action needed for me
my attitude towards myself

iâm not afraid because itâs me
love myself

to the very end

why do you keep trying to hide under your mask? (hey)
even all the scars from your mistakes make up your constellation (ey)

i should love myself
(iâm learning how to love myself oh)

"i know that youâre hesitating because even if you say the truth
in the end it will all return as scars
iâm not going to say anything blatant like âfind strengthâ
i will let you hear my story, let you hear it

what did i say?
i said youâd win, didnât i?
i couldnât believe it (really)
could i win it?
this miracle that isnât a miracle
did we make it?
(no) i was here
you were the one that made your way to me
i do believe your galaxy
i want to listen to your melody
your stars in the milky way
donât forget that i found you anyways
at the end of my despair
youâre the last reason
for me who was standing at the edge of the cliff
live

on days i hate being myself, days i want to disappear forever
let's make a door in your heart
open the door and this place will await
it's okay to believe, the magic shop will comfort you

while drinking a glass of hot tea
and looking up at the milky way
youâll be alright, oh, this here is the magic shop

so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
show you show you

like a rose when blooming
like cherry blossoms when being scattered in the wind
like morning glory when fading
like that beautiful moment
i always want to be the best
so i was impatient and always restless
comparing myself with others became my daily life
my greed that was my weapon suffocated me and also became a leash
but looking back on it now, truthfully
i feel like itâs not true that i wanted to be the best
i wanted to become your comfort and move your heart
i want to take away your sadness, and pain

on days where i hate myself for being me, on days where i want to disappear forever
let's make a door. it's in your heart
open the door and this place will await
magic shop

while drinking a glass of hot tea
and looking up at the milky way
youâll be alright, oh, this here is the magic shop

so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
show you show you

would you believe me if i said that i was scared of everything too?
all the sincerity, the remaining times
all your answers are in this place you found
in your milky way, inside your heart

you gave me the best of me
so you'll give you the best of you
you found me. you knew me
you gave me the best of me
so you'll give you the best of you
you'll find it, the galaxy inside you

so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
so show me (i'll show you)
show you show you",0

he sang as if he was breathing

he only wanted to do music
only singing

youâre a singing star
youâre a singing star

(i still) who should i live as today, kim namjoon or rm?

i got a few hundred thousand mileage
itâs time to console you who couldnât make it

"who am i? the question i had my whole life
the question which i probably wonât find an answer to my whole life
if i were answerable with a few more words
then god wouldnât have created all these various beauties
how you feel? howâre you feeling right now?
actually iâm real good but a little uncomfortable
i'm still not so sure if i'm a dog or a pig or what else
but then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
ptui!
i laugh more than i did before
i dreamt of becoming a superhero
now it feels like i really became one
but as it goes on thereâs so much blabbering
one says, ""run"" another says, ""stop""
this one says, ""look at the forest"" that one says, ""look at the wild flower""
my shadow, i wrote and called it hesitation
it has never hesitated after becoming that
it keeps appearing under the stage or the light
keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (oh shit)
hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this
you were just digging it that someone was listening
sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
you know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity
someone like me ain't good enough for music
someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
the flaws of mine that i know
maybe that's all i've got really
the world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
the regrets that i don't even get sick of anymore
i tumble with them every night until i'm disgusted
and twist the irreversible time habitually
there's something that raised me up again every time
the first question
the three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those
so i'm askin' once again yeah
who the hell am i?
tell me all your names baby
do you wanna die?
oh do you wanna go?
do you wanna fly?
where's your soul? where's your dream?
do you think you're alive?
i don't know man
but i know one thing
my name is r
the 'me' that i remember and people know
the 'me' that i created myself to vent out
yeah maybe i have been deceiving myself
maybe i've been lying
but i'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
dear myself
you must never lose your temperature
cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
though i might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
this is the barometer of my direction i want to keep
the 'me' that i want myself to be
the 'me' that people want me to be
the 'me' that you love
and the 'me' that i create
the 'me' that's smiling
the me that's sometimes in tears
vividly breathing each second and every moment even now
persona
who the hell am i
i just wanna go
i just wanna fly
i just wanna give you all the voices till i die
i just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

with a voice a little more solid

now i'll spread wide a map called you

look at me, why can't you recognize me?
i don't want to hear other people's noises
your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down

i can make it better

I still have a dream I'm still in the studio
Ask the people passing by
Who's the one shot singer?
Grammys are right in front of our noses
This is for real
Being proud of the money we earn from TV
It's cute now, right?
Sometimes I ask myself, ""Is this is a dream?""
The darkness before the sunrise seems especially dark
On the other hand, in front of the path that I've walked on
The timing and the right and wrongs
You just have to know that
The footsteps we have
Are even compared to the people who have walked in front of us
The choice is now up to me
What you gonna do?


Uh huh, ayy, she calls me charming, need an ARMY
Marching for your love, I'm a sergeant
I'm not from this planet, a martian
For you, I go the hardest
Can't stop when you get me started
You gonna make me park the Aston Martin
Tints on the windows, I don't do no talking
Oh, girl, I told you from the go
I need you to stay with me, loyal and faithfully
Ever so gracefully touching my soul
I know that you pray for me
Try make a way for me
Girl, you know I'ma always hold you close
Never let go, nope you
Never let go, uh uh, of you
All or nothing for ya love, I'ma risk it all
If it's not your name coming up on my phone, I won't pick up the call
Not at all
Love the way you take it off
On my rocket, you taking off
Yeah, we done got love involved, love involved


We keep all the party in this room all night
We don't wanna put it on the brake, hold tight
'Til the sun sets continue doing it even more all night
Courage just wait a bit, I'll catch you, all mine

"Did I perhaps tell you? At times when even I didnÕt know my own heart You really reassured me When I lean on you and look on wordlessly I wonder how much time we have spent together Even if you donÕt speak, I understand you Even if I just look into your eyes Your heart turns towards me When I look at you I start to hum Lalalalala things will become better Do you by chance remember? When tomorrows felt uncertain You said We can do it if we are together Someday, even if Other people donÕt understand you Even if you donÕt speak, I understand you Even if I just look into your eyes Your heart turns towards me When I look at you I start to hum Lalalalala things will become betterOh better day with you...",0
"When I was a young boy dreaming small dreams
The world seemed like a giant to me
What do I want, where do I go?
I spent all of my days worrying


You are here
I have you here
Thanks for being my light in the dark
I trust that you
Are always behind me
Thanks for always being by my side


When I feel so tired of the weight of life
What helps me more than anything else is
The story of us that made us closer than anyone
The times we've laughed and smiled


You are here
I have you here
Thanks for being my light in the dark
The trust that you
Are always behinds me
Thanks for always being by my side




You are here
I have you here
Thanks for looking out for me now


The meaning of ""us""
That has been watching over me
The times we're together are so precious
I will promise
Forever unchanging
Walking one step at a time with you


Until that day we shine bright together",0
"so iâm not the best at saying things in an organized mannerâ¦ but know thatâiâalways want toâtell you all the beautiful thingsâand do things that will make you feel good. my heart has not changed. it is still here, it has matured, it has grown even bigger. i try to keep my comments short because the longer it gets, the more confused i become. but itâs not easy. i really purple you all though
no matter how old i get, i will keep coming back with more love for everyone. i may not be much, but please let me be your pride and joy. i will strive to remain your awesome son, grandson, friend, younger brother, and an older brother who makes you proud

time goes by so diligently. even when everything else comes to a stop, time does not. it keeps going. this is our record that has finally seen light after such a long period. these are the memoirs of our footsteps past. these are the sounds that are frozen in space. and as special as the year 2020 is on its own, i am thrilled to be putting down the seven of our names on the album, with no other words to describe us
every time an album is released, i tend to get emotional. nonetheless, i am grateful that the seven of us have reached a new stage. weâve passed through countless dimensions and probabilities to get here. i am thankful that this book has come to be. i am honored to be holding on to this much luck. thank you
i know better now though â that the seven of us are not the only ones standing on the empty stage in the dark. i now see the silhouettes of everyone who has been here with us throughout our history. some of them are tucked low, some are hanging unreachably high. i must say, that is what iâve learned after 7 years of running toward the truth
i still donât know all the names of those to whom i owe thanks. i probably canât even write them all down. but i know that these names belong to my family, friends, the members, the agency, all the staff members and associates in the industry, and even to a brief message of encouragement from an unknown face. we all wear different name tags when we meet at different points in our lives, but i know that at this moment, i am able to smile and write this thank you note because of everyone who treated me with love when they crossed paths with me
i know though, there is one final name that deserves to be at the end of this short story. and that name would belong to armys. when i read out the word army, it sounds korean, but at times it also sounds english. sometimes it even sounds spanish. on that name tag, i see the names and faces of all armys around this planet. i fall asleep embracing these names that have come pouring into my arms like falling stars. i shall have a good dream â and i shall find a good vibe to keep going. would this not be what true love looks like? i love you all. thank you. hereâs to another record of us

while being able to make an album and have people listen to our songs is a precious and happy thing, iâm always thinking of how to make more heartfelt songs that can touch all those that listen to our songs. it is because of this that making an album has a big meaning for us. i want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the efforts and work of the people that helped us create this album
i know that words are not enough to express how thankful i am to bang pd, yoon seok jun and the rest of the big hit entertainment family. i want to show you how much more we can grow just like how much we have grown so far. i am deeply thankful
i am also so sorry and thankful to all the staff and the design team. you sleep less and work harder than us and i know i donât express myself enough. it is because of your efforts that we are able to shine brightly. thank you from the bottom of my heart
to my members. just thank you. i know i shouldnât take you all for granted but i keep thinking itâs just natural. i canât imagine not having all of you. so i hope to continue going forward with all of you for a long, long time. i will try my best to do better. thank you so much and i love you
to army. itâs already been 7 years since weâve been together. i think weâve been able to share a lot of happy emotions together by talking about music. although there is happiness that comes from simply being happy, i think happiness that is earned through sharing our feelings is something i am truly grateful for. it is a blessing that i was able to meet all of you. iâm really curious to see how many more precious memories we will have together as the years go by. until then, i hope to continue to share this with my members and all of you. lastly, as i said before, having people listen to our music is our biggest happiness. i know i always say this but the reason we exist and are able to sing on stage is because of all you. thank you. i love you

another full album has been released. first of all, iâd like to share this honor with our army. if it werenât for all of you, there would be no meaning of us making music. thank you and i love you army
much love to my family who is always by my side and giving me strength
and to the big hit family. now there is more staff that i donât know that i do know but i will never forget the efforts and work of all our staff. i am happy to be able to work with the worldâs best staff
to the bts members. preparing for this album was hard work and iâm glad that all our efforts werenât wasted because we were able to complete a really amazing album. i am happy to have worked with all of you for this album. letâs promote this album well~
i also want to say thank you to all the people who listen to our music. i believe that music that doesnât have people listening to it is incomplete music. thank you for completing our album",0
"who am i? the question i had my whole life
the question which i probably wonât find an answer to my whole life
if i were answerable with a few more words
then god wouldnât have created all these various beauties
how you feel? howâre you feeling right now?
actually iâm real good but a little uncomfortable
i'm still not so sure if i'm a dog or a pig or what else
but then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
ptui!
i laugh more than i did before
i dreamt of becoming a superhero
now it feels like i really became one
but as it goes on thereâs so much blabbering
one says, ""run"" another says, ""stop""
this one says, ""look at the forest"" that one says, ""look at the wild flower""
my shadow, i wrote and called it hesitation
it has never hesitated after becoming that
it keeps appearing under the stage or the light
keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (oh shit)
hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this
you were just digging it that someone was listening
sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
you know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity
someone like me ain't good enough for music
someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
the flaws of mine that i know
maybe that's all i've got really
the world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
the regrets that i don't even get sick of anymore
i tumble with them every night until i'm disgusted
and twist the irreversible time habitually
there's something that raised me up again every time
the first question
the three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those
so i'm askin' once again yeah
who the hell am i?
tell me all your names baby
do you wanna die?
oh do you wanna go?
do you wanna fly?
where's your soul? where's your dream?
do you think you're alive?
i don't know man
but i know one thing
my name is r
the 'me' that i remember and people know
the 'me' that i created myself to vent out
yeah maybe i have been deceiving myself
maybe i've been lying
but i'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
dear myself
you must never lose your temperature
cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
though i might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
this is the barometer of my direction i want to keep
the 'me' that i want myself to be
the 'me' that people want me to be
the 'me' that you love
and the 'me' that i create
the 'me' that's smiling
the me that's sometimes in tears
vividly breathing each second and every moment even now
persona
who the hell am i
i just wanna go
i just wanna fly
i just wanna give you all the voices till i die
i just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

"the moment i noticed myself
i had to leave
i had to find out
all day all night

across the desert and the sea
this wide, wide world
i wandered
baby i

i could make it better
i could hold you tighter
on that long road
oh you're the light
uninvited
unwelcome
the only one who recognized me

this eternal night with no end in sight
it's you who gifted me the morning
can i now hold that hand?
oh oh
i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

i became a hero in this world
the loud screams that seek me out
my hand, trophy and a gold microphone
all day, everywhere
but all of this is about reaching you
it's the answer to my journey
i'm singing to find you
baby to you

a little taller than i was before
with a voice a little more solid
all of this to go back to you
now i'll spread wide a map called you
my rehab
look at me, why can't you recognize me?
i don't want to hear other people's noises
your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
let's go back to that time

baby i know
i can make it better
i can hold you tighter
all those roads
are pointing to you

everything was useless
anything other than you
just touch me like that time

this eternal night with no end in sight
it's you who gifted me the morning
now can i hold that hand?
oh oh
i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

you are still beautiful
just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
the reason i survived in hell
it's for you, it was not for me
if you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
i'm thirsty wandering this desert without you
so hurry and grab me quickly
i know the sea without you is the same as a desert

i can hold you tighter

anything other than you

because it hurts so much
i need to heal my medic

it always hurts like it's the first time

i run but the shadow follows, as dark as the light's intense
iâm afraid, flying high is terrifying
no one told me how lonely it is up here
i can leap in the air but also plunge, now i know
running away could be an option too, pause
people say, thereâs splendor in that bright light

or cry instead â what are you scared of?
wasnât this the kind of thing youâd been wanting?

the life you chose: you achieved everything without regrets
and on top of that, you have a big house, big cars, big rings
all the things you wanted, youâve got it all

life not of j-hope but jeong ho-seok flashes by
it must have been full of regret with no hope till i die
(2 cool, 2 cool 4 skool)
my dancing was chasing ghosts
blaming my dream, asking why i live and breathe
oh my god (god, god, god)
uh time goes by
seven years of anguish come out finally
oppressions all resolved
into my heart come answers from my most trusted
âonly one hope, only one soulâ
âonly one smile, only one youâ
definite answer to the truth of the world
only one and unchanging me, right

now i don't care, it's all
choices by my fate, so we're here
look ahead, the way is shinin'
keep goin' now
(ready, set, and begin)

that way, way, way
wherever my way
only ego ego ego
just trust myself

way i trust, way i go
became my fate, became my core
hard it was, and sad it was
still reassured and made me know myself
map of the soul, map of the all
that's my ego, that's my ego
map of the soul, map of the all
that's my ego, that's my ego",0
"i can't understand what people are sayin'
who and what do i need to follow
with eachâstepâthen again growsâthe shadow
where is this place iâopen my eyes to
maybe seoul or new york or paris
i get up, unsteady on my feet

look at my feet, look down
the shadow resembles me
is it the shadow that's shaking
or is it my feet that are trembling
of course iâm not unafraid
of course it's not all okay
but i know
awkwardly i flow
i fly together with that black wind

hey na-na-na
gotta go insane to stay sane
hey na-na-na
throw myself whole into both worlds
hey na-na-na

bring the pain
it'll become my blood and flesh
bring the pain
no fear, now that i know the way
breathe on the small things
my air and my light in the dark
the power of the things that make me, âmeâ
even if i fall, i come right up, scream

even if i fall, i come right up, scream
that's how we've always been
even if my knees drop to the ground
as long as they don't get buried
it won't matter
win no matter what
whatever you say, whatever they say
i don't give a uhh

"I remember
I, I, I remember
Ah, ah
One day, the world stopped
Without any warning
Spring didn't know that it had to wait
Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased all of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology
It looks like it's going to rain again today
I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that would be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
It hurts so bad
This cold that the world gave me
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale a warmer breath
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand
To the future, let's run away
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again
Let me tell you with this song
People say the world has changed
Mh-hm-hm-hm
But thankfully between you and me
Nothing has changed
With the 'annyeong' that we start and finish the day with
Let us thread tomorrow with today (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
Stopped for now, but don't hide in the shadow
Only again, daylight will glow
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand (Hold it)
To the future, let's run away (Oh, oh, oh)
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on

"Let's go, let me fly to my
Lower your gaze and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
Everyday
It's so frustrating, it's driving me crazy
Feel like it's still day one
Somebody turn back the clock
The entire year got stolen
I'm still in bed
A bloated stomach
It's killin' me slowly, nah
Anyway
I want to leave any way
There's no way
This room is all I have
Then, what can I do here?
Into my world
Let's change it, yeah
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Lower your gaze and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
Everywhere
I wonder if this place was like this
Suddenly this strange scenery
I'm absorbed by memories
Even the old desks, the changed sunlight
Looks special
I'm little less lonely, nah
Better way
I just found a better way
Sometimes we get to know
Broken is beautiful
My body is light
Fly away
This thing is so surreal
Yeah
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Lower your gaze and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
This room is too small
Yes, to contain my dream (Yah, yah, yah)
Landing over the bed
This is the safest place
Somehow there's no joy, no sadness, no emotion
It's just me here
Sometimes this room becomes an emotional trash can
It hugs me
They greet me again
The toys in my room, like people
It's as crowded as if we're out of the city
The TV sound
I just have to change my thoughts
This is a journey that only I can enjoy
Delivery food
Fill it up with optimism, I'm full
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Lower your gaze and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Lower your gaze and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues

"Where is my angel?
The end of the day
Someone come and save me, please
A weary sigh of a tiring day
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror
My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey
I don't know where it went wrong
Since my youth, I've had a blue question mark in my head
Maybe that's why I've been living so fiercely
But when I look back, I'm all by myself
That hazy shadow that swallows me up
The blue question mark still exists
Is it anxiety or depression?
How am I so regretful?
Or is it just me, one that loneliness gave birth to
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't erode away, I'll find the exit
I just wanna be happier
To melt the cold me
My hands have reached out countless times
Colorless echo
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?
I felt when I walked on the cold winter streets
The sound of my fast heartbeat breathing
I still feel it
Don't say it's okay
'Cause it's not okay
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much
On the road I always walk
There is a light that always shines
But today, the scene feels unfamiliar
Is it dull or is it broken?
This lump of metal feels heavy
A grey rhino is approaching
I'm just standing there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like color make me cringe
A vast grey area is way more comfortable
Hundreds of millions of grey facial expressions here
When it rains, it's my world
I dance over this city
On a clear day, bring some fog
On rainy days, we're always together
A toast to all the dust here
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth of my hands
They're not warm, so I need you more
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
In the distant future, when I smile
I'll tell you I did
After secretly sending my words up into the air
Now I fall asleep at dawn, good night",0

Jin: Guess you don't need a birthday gift!
Jung Kook: This... this doesn't make any sense
RM: We should gift ourselves with something
J-hope: This is the biggest gift!
Jung Kook: This is the best gift of my life... what... what just happened...

Jimin: ""No More Dream."" Guys, don't worry
RM: No, we are doing a ""back to first mindset"" project, practicing ""No More Dream"" when we're No. 1
SUGA: First intention? What first intention!?
RM: No Hyung, look. How cool is it? Do Billboard No. 1 singer practice their debut song on the day of No. 1 announcement?
V: Write that into a song
RM: How? (rapping) I practiced ""No More Dream"" today, too!
Jimin: That is interesting though, practicing ""No More Dream"" today

I wake up in the morning like wild grass
I check you like a mirror
You're the only one in my eyes
Another heavy bruise Murphak
I stroll around and think about this star
Allowing our distance
Oh, can I be your Bibilly Hills
Like you did the same to me
(Baby)
Too fast is a little dangerous
Too slow is a little boring
Without going too fast
Or going too slow

Break down, what should we do?
I'm the one who eats three meals a day
My sin, a dog biting me while I rest

Even if I scream, I'm hungry for achievements every day

Whatever label is attached to me after this time
I hope that's all you
You, you, you
Everybody's got a lot of diseases, I'm confused by that
That humankind is inherently disgusting
400 more cases of heart disease
There aren't many people that don't work
Yo, is it the world or me that's sick?
Is it just a difference in interpretation?
I don't know if that's all
I don't know how to change someone
Something faster than that is me changing

It's morning again, I have to take it today
Let's go, one more night

"I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage rightâhereâalways far fromâme (Yes, it's here)
I'm a bornâsinger, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway,âI'mâsoâhappy, I'm good,âwhoa, whoa, yeah-yeah


(SUGA)
Theâvery first stage, named as Bangtan
Remind the mind three years ago I had
Still I'm nothing different from a rural Daegu rapper but
I became a pro, no more amateur
When I'm on stage rapping and dancing which I wanted so badly
I feel alive although it's hard and tough
I can handle it cause you're supporting me
I can stand the pain cause I can hear shouting my name
I'm in a boundary between idol and rapper
Still my notes are full of rhymes
I write down the lyrics between on and off stage
Do I look something different I used to be?
Damn, shit, I am still who I am
Did someone say I've changed? Go tell them
Nothing changed, I'm still rapperman
I still rap and sing as three years ago, I'm out

I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage right here always far from me (Yes, it's here)
I'm a born singer, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway, I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah-yeah


Frankly I was afraid to prove the big mouth I've told
How to surprise the world with something else, I dunno
Maybe I'll let you down
I was afraid of making my people down
But I straighten my shoulders and make my debut
The moment of silence, get my breath back
The people I've seen are now staring at me
Fancy TV stars are now below me
Uh, it was a very fast time the only once play has started
It just took three minutes to show my three years the fierce fought with mic
Though it's a few seconds, I put everything in, I'm fuckin real
Hey, what is your dream? Mine is a rapstar, can't you feel
The shouts after the stage, yeah, I could read your mind (Uh, yeah)
I could read your mind, no more questions, just smile (Uh, yeah)
My team just tapped my shoulder
It seems like yesterday, but already past 20 days
And let the haters hate on me, it's their job
When you play with the keyboard, I've made my career
Sunglasses, hair style, know why you insult me
Anyway on 20 years old I'm better than you

I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage right here always far from me (Yes, it's here)
I'm a born singer, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway, I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah-yeah


Remember the days we've been through
Three years, we were as one
My blood and sweat drench me
After the stage tears well up in my eyes
Every single time I swear not to forget the very first intention
Always myself, live up to myself
So we go, we go, we go (We go)
Up, up, up (Up)


I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage right here always far from me (Yes, it's here)
I'm a born singer, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway, I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah-yeah",0

What is your dream? (What is?)
What is your dream? (What is?)
Is your dream just that?


I wanna big house, big cars, and big rings
But actually I don't have any big dreams
Ha, ha, I live so comfortably
Even I donât have any dream, no one says anything
Everyone thinks the same as I am
The completely forgotten childhood that was filled with so many dreams
Don't worry about university, I'll go somewhere even if itâs far away
Okay, mom, I'm going to the study room right now

What were you dreaming to become?
Who do you see now in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live one day
Do something
Put your weakness away


Why aren't you saying anything? I thought you said you didn't want to study
You are afraid of dropping out of school, aren't you? See, you're already getting ready for school
Grow up, you are just all talk, you have a glass mentality boy
Stop! Ask yourself, have you ever tried hard?


Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)

See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please don't force me
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
What is your dream? What is your dream?
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
Is your dream just that? Is your dream only that?

Okay, the boring same day, every day just repeats
Adults and parents cram us with dreams stuck in place
The No. 1 dream job, a government employee?
The dream wasnât forced, a relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth


Throw a fastball towards self-study that is a waste of time
Disobey the hell of a society, grant a special pardon to your dream
Ask yourself what is your dreamâs profile
Become the subject of your own life that's always been suppressed


What were you dreaming to become?
Who do you see now in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live one day
Do something
Put your weakness away


Hey, whatâs your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Is your dream just that?

It's a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please donât force me
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
What is your dream? What is your dream?
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
Is your dream just that? Is your dream only that?


You don't know how to live
You don't know how to fly
You don't know how to decide
Now you don't even know how to dream
Open your eyes, eyes, eyes
Everyone, now dance, dance, dance
Now, dream, dream, dream again
Don't move slowly, don't hesitate, wassup!


It's a lie, you such a liar (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please don't force me

"Yo, right in here
BTS, we dropped the second ball
CS, the revolution started again


A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?


Dream is gone, no time to breathe
School, house and PC room is all we have
We live the same life
And have to become number one
For us it's like a double spy between dream and reality

Who is the one who made us into study machines?
It's either number one or a failure
They trap us in borders, the adults
Thereâs no choice but to consent
Even if we think simply, itâs the survival of the fittest
Who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? What?


Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later


Everybody say NO!
It's not going to work anymore
Don't be captured in others dreams
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!
It has to be now
We've done nothing yet
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!


A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?

I want to eat and have fun, I want to tear my uniform
Make money, good money, but they already view me crookedly
My obscure bank account, my unhappiness is past its limit
A factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle


Adults say that we have it so easy
They say I'm on my way to happiness
Then how do you explain my unhappiness?
There's no conversation topics other than studying
Outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
Who will take responsibility?


Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later


Everybody say NO!

It's always like this, you are you, I am me
That's your kind of formula
Your cellphone is just an accessory
Am I really your boyfriend? Iâm sick of this
Why do you put off your feelings like homework?
Are we doing business? Or do you hate me?
Be more affectionate
Today I put a spell on you again

We're like parallel lines, looking at the same spot but so different
You're the only one I have
But why do I feel like you're not there
You ask me ""Are you mad at me?"" when I'm down
Have you ever done anything to make me down?
You're cute and I'm just pathetic
Hope a miracle happens so that you love me more than I love you


You don't have me, but I'm so full of you
I'm going crazy
So why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool out of me?
I'm warning you now
Don't make me confused


Are you kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy? Uh, are you playing with me?
You're in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don't make me confused
Are you kidding me? What am I to you?

You're so mean to me
You're so mean to me
You're so mean to me
Don't make me confused


Missed calls, unlock, you're wanted
I'm trying to find out your real intention
You always send me 1 or 2 lines of text messages
Is this the relationship I've wanted and dreamed of?
Where did all the love stories go?
Get the main characters of TV dramas out of my way
I grab my hair like this hundreds of times
You look calm, you dump me


What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always hear your news from your friends
I want you, want you, uh, I want you
You're a swindler, you're a criminal who shook my heart
You used me up before you got caught on fire
My efforts to win your heart were a waste of time
I'm just a friend to you, you seem to like that more
I'm a love loser

You don't have me, but I'm so full of you
I'm going crazy
So why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool out of me?
I'm warning you now
Don't make me confused

My body, mind, and soul
I know well they're all yours
This is a spell that will punish me
Peaches and cream, sweeter than sweet
Chocolate cheeks and chocolate wings
But your wings are the devil's
There is a bitter next to your sweet
Kiss me, it's okay if it hurts
Just make it as tight
As that I can't feel the pain anymore
Baby, it's okay if I  get drunk
I'll drink you in deep now
Deep into my throat
The whiskey that is you

My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away

Take it all away

It doesn't matter if it hurts
Tie me up so I can't escape
Hold me tight and shake me up
So that I can't come to my senses
Kiss me on the lips
A secret just between the two of us
Deeply poisoned by the jail of you
I cannot worship anyone but you and I knew
The grail was poisoned but I drank it anyway


My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath
Take it all away
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more

Want it more and more

Seeing each other is now more difficult
It's all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on time, alone on the Snowpiercer
I want to go to the other side of Earth, holding your hand, put an end to winter
How much should my longings fall like snow
Before the days of spring return, friend?

Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
I could've reached you faster
If I was snow flying in the air


Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little

How many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)


Pass the end of winter's cold
Until the spring day comes again
Until the flowers bloom again
Please stay, please stay there a little longer


Is it you who changed? (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me? (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We've changed, you know?
Just like everyone, you know?
Yes, I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
I miss you, honestly, but Iâll erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you

I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that Iâll erase you
But I canât really let you go yet


Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little
I miss you (I miss you)

And how many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)

The morning will come again
No darkness, no season can last forever


Maybe cherries are blossoming
And winter is going to be over

I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
Iâll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)

Got no fears, I'm singin', oh-oh-woah-oh-oh

One day, the world stopped
Without any warning
Spring didn't know to wait
Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology, yeah

It looks like rain again today
I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop (Hey)
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that'd be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
I'm in a world of pain
This cold the damn world gave to me (Woo)
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale
A warmer breath


There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand
To that future, let's run away


Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again

Let me tell you with this song (Ayy)
People say the world has changed (No)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
But thankfully between you and me
Nothing's changed


With the 'annyeong' that we start and finish the day
Let us thread tomorrow with today (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
Stopped for now but don't hide in the shadow
Once again daylight will glow


There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment (Close it)
Hold my hand (Hold it)
To that future, let's run away (Oh, oh, oh)


Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around

"Yo


Who am I? The question I had my whole life
The question which I probably wonât find an answer to my whole life
If I were answerable with a few more words
Then God wouldnât have created all these various beauties
How you feel? Howâre you feeling right now?
Actually Iâm real good but a little uncomfortable
I'm still not so sure if I'm a dog or a pig or what else
But then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
Ptui!
I laugh more than I did before
I dreamt of becoming a superhero
Now it feels like I really became one
But as it goes on thereâs so much blabbering
One says, ""Run"" another says, ""Stop""
This one says, ""Look at the forest"" that one says, ""Look at the wild flower""

My shadow, I wrote and called it hesitation
It has never hesitated after becoming that
It keeps appearing under the stage or the light
Keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (Oh shit)
Hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this
You were just digging it that someone was listening
Sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
You know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity


Someone like me ain't good enough for music
Someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
Someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
Someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
The flaws of mine that I know
Maybe that's all I've got really
The world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
The regrets that I don't even get sick of anymore
I tumble with them every night until I'm disgusted
And twist the irreversible time habitually
There's something that raised me up again every time
The first question
The three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those


So I'm askin' once again yeah
Who the hell am I?
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die?
Oh do you wanna go?
Do you wanna fly?
Where's your soul? where's your dream?
Do you think you're alive?

Ah, shit
I don't know man
But I know one thing


My name is R
The 'me' that I remember and people know
The 'me' that I created myself to vent out
Yeah maybe I have been deceiving myself
Maybe I've been lying
But I'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
Dear myself
You must never lose your temperature
Cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
Though I might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
This is the barometer of my direction I want to keep
The 'me' that I want myself to be
The 'me' that people want me to be
The 'me' that you love
And the 'me' that I create
The 'me' that's smiling
The me that's sometimes in tears
Vividly breathing each second and every moment even now


Persona
Who the hell am I
I just wanna go
I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you all the voices till I die
I just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

Rather than thanking you

Way more brightly
I'll stay by your side

A memory that will be left just for me

If I just turn it off, will all be more comfortable?


I'm fine but I'm not fine
I told myself I was used to it
It always hurts like it's the first time

Not a good gamer, that's right, you can't control me
It keeps hurting 'cause of trial and error and 50,000-something else

I become afraid of every word, my jamais vu

A remedy that will make my heart beat again

with meaningless emotional drains
repeated seesaw game
now, i'm so sick of this
repeated seesaw game
we're getting sick and tired of each other
were the petty arguments the start?
the moment i became heavier than you
because there have never been parallels in the first place
maybe it was my greed trying to match myself with you
if it was love, and if this is what love means
is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
we're tired of each other, yet seem to be holding the same cards
well, then
alright, a repeating seesaw game
it's about time we put an end to it
all right, this boring seesaw game
somebody has to get off of it

letâs not drag things out
let's follow our hearts
let's put an end to this
this repeated seesaw game
let's end this now
people can be so crafty
we know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
but because we don't want to be the villains
in the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
we became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
although this wasn't the kind of parallel that i wanted
at first, we showed off who was heavier
we bragged and smiled at each other
now we're trying measure who's heavier
a competition between us
that became a flame, igniting quarrels
itâll only end if someone gets off right here
acting like weâre comforting each other
with words mixed with thorns
canât keep doing this, we need to make a decision
if we didnât have feelings for each other
if we didnât think of each other
would we have dragged it out like this?
now if you donât have any more feelings
this seesaw is dangerous
stop thinking about me

it's about time we put an end to it

Who the fella told you crazy?
I'm better than ya lazy

Uncertain, ambiguous all of them have some manners
Those who can't even continue on one verse
Because they try to discuss rap or music
That's why here they all still rap the same way like this
Only three or two words, They're all critical patients

Make money with rocks, sell rocks, you frauds
San Paulo to Stockholm, Places you'll never sit in your entire life I sit

Haters I have a lot but no problem, I kill
The shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
Bitch I don't care, You can't control my shit
I became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again


This fourth albums focus point cypher
When this track comes out haters will totally turn from the worse
On this scene that's about illegal things
This songs legality will make everyone fall into a trap
Hang hang over bang
Explode and come out Swag
Whenever I go, I drive straight
And wherever I go, it's there the losers of hip-hop
They're at a different proportion of levels to be cussing at me
Busy by my talking has come, all unnies call me Beep Beep
Someone's cussing at me
Tell them to look at their own situation and then come to me
I don't have anything to be jealous of about others
Oh on top of the beat beat I wiggle wiggling jingle jingling
I roll, roll around, Act like a beagle, then I start to burn up
Strength right now right now
Ruling over on top of the on top of the ring
A king who will surpass the name of a god
This is just a sample, just a snack
My rap will soon be a Korean meal to fill your stomach
That's right, my nation Korea
All the rap Mansiks' trying to spit out poor English
Look at who's on top of you now


Haters I have a lot but no problem, I kill
The shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
Bitch I don't care, You can't control my shit
I became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again


S-U-G-A a.k.a Agust D, My second name
When I walk in the streets, they whisper my name
From Daegu to Apgujeong my beat that have been laid
The lives of my music that breath and live here and there all over the world
Iâm a baby shaman who dances on the jakdu called the beat, thatâs me
My self that is shown through the TV
Did you know that half of it is a kagemusha?
You're all just big talk with your mouth, but that's rapping
The spirit of my heavy king rap that hits towards the lies of the solicit nompaengis
Rappers who act arrogant
My flow job that takes them all and toys around with them
If you try to damage me with simple words like that
I only become stronger
The mysterious me is a bulgasari who grows by eating your jealousy and envy
Like you all know my voice turns people on
Whether it be men or women
My flexible tongue movements will send them to Hong Kong with my raps
On top of the food chain
I'm always on the highest point of the summit
My idiocy that won't end
Even if someone tries to try to fuck me over from the back
While you guys play around
We're going around the world
Hyungnims who gained age carelessly
From my standards, you're at the level of a kid too
Even if I'm wack or if I'm fake if I'm this or that
I'm the new standard of the music industry
This rap will throw a slap an endless slap at their ears chop chop chop

Haters I have a lot but no problem, I kill
The shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
Bitch I don't care, You can't control my shit
I became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again",0
"We're now going to progress to some steps
Which are a bit more difficult
Ready, set, andâbegin
Bighitâexclusive, exclusive

B-BulletproofâBoy Scouts


I go back every day
Toâme of yesterday
To the life of giving up
I let myself go away
But in this world, you know
There are truths unchanged
Time rushes ever forward
There's no ifs, buts, or maybes
Almost forgotten memories return
Touch of the devil, fateful recall
I still wonder, why did they beckon again
Every day ask me, guess it, whip it, repeat oh
Nothing that will change, so
I lock it up again, close
How much love? How much joy?
Soothe myself and stay calm, alone

Yeah, I don't care, it's all
Choices by my fate, so we're here
Look ahead, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now

That way, way, way
Wherever my way

Blaming my dream, asking why I live and breathe
Oh my God (God, God, God)
Uh time goes by
Seven years of anguish come out finally
Oppressions all resolved
Into my heart come answers from my most trusted
Only one hope, only one soul
Only one smile, only one you
Definite answer to the truth of the world
Only one and unchanging me, right

Now I don't care, it's all
Choices by my fate, so we're here
Look ahead, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now

Still reassured and made me know myself (Just trust myself)

"A sound of something breaking
I awake from sleep
A sound full of unfamiliarity
Try to cover my ears but can't go to sleep


The pain in my throat gets worse
Try to cover it
I don't have a voice
Today I hear that sound again

It's ringing again, that sound
A crack again on this frozen lake
I dumped myself into the lake
I buried my voice for you
Over the winter lake I was thrown


A thick ice has formed
In the dream I shortly went into
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same
Have I lost myself


Or have I gained you
I suddenly run to the lake
There's my face in it
Please donât say anything


Reach my hand out to cover the mouth
But in the end, spring will come someday
The ice will melt and flow away


Tell me if my voice isn't real
If I shouldn't have thrown myself away
Tell me if even this pain isn't real
What I was supposed to do back then",0

Thinking if it was my fault?

I should've told you more (Told you)
I'll be with you
For the rest of my life, ooh, ooh, yeah
Rest of my life",0
