# Drake-or-BTS

This web app uses a Python Flask backend and HTML frontend to deploy a Naive Bayes machine learning model. Users can input lyrics, and the model predicts whether they are closer to Drake or BTS. The app processes the input in the backend, passes it to the trained model, and displays the prediction on the frontend. It provides a simple way to classify lyrics based on the artist's style using only Python and HTML.
